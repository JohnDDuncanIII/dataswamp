    <p align=justify>As a retainer of the Nabeshima clan, one should have the 
      intention of studying our province's history and traditions, but provincial 
      studies are made light of nowadays. The basic reason for this study is to 
      understand the foundation of our clan, and to know that the clan's forefathers 
      established its perpetuity by means of their suffering and compassion. The 
      fact that our clan has perpetually continued in an unrivaled manner up to 
      this very day is due to the humanity and martial valor of Master Ryuzoji 
      Iekane, the charity and faith of Master Nabeshima Kiyohisa, and the appearance 
      of Lord Ryuzoji Takanobu and Lord Nabeshima Naoshige and their might.<br>
      <br>
      I am at a complete loss when it comes to understanding why people of this 
      generation have forgotten these things and respect the Buddhas of other 
      places. Neither the Shakyamuni Buddha, nor Confucius, nor Kusunoki, nor 
      Shingen were ever retainers of the Ryuzojis or the Nabeshimas; hence it 
      cannot be said that they are in harmony with our clan's customs. In times 
      of war or in times of peace it would be sufficient if both the upper and 
      lower classes would worship our ancestors and study their teachings. One 
      worships the head of whatever clan or discipline to which he belongs. Outside 
      learning for retainers of our clan is worthless. One may think that it is 
      fine to study other disciplines as a diversion after his provincial studies 
      are replete. Yet if a person has a good understanding of provincial studies, 
      he will see that there is nothing lacking in them.<br>
      Today, if someone from another clan were to ask about the origin of the 
      Ryuzojis and the Nabeshimas, or why the fief was transferred from the former 
      to the latter, or if they were to ask something like, "I have heard that 
      the Ryuzojis and the Nabeshimas are the greatest in Kyushu for deeds of 
      martial valor, but can you tell me some of the particulars?" I suppose that 
      the man with no knowledge of provincial studies would not be able to answer 
      a word.<br>
      <br>
      For a retainer there should be nothing other than doing his own job. For 
      the most part people dislike their own jobs, find those of others more interesting, 
      cause misunderstanding, and bring on utter disasters. Good models of men 
      who performed their duty in their work are Lord Naoshige and Lord Katsushige. 
      The retainers of those times all performed their duties. From the upper 
      classes, men who would be of good use were searched out, while from the 
      lower classes men desired to be useful. The minds of the two classes were 
      of mutual accord , and the strength of the clan was secure.<br>
      <br>
      In all our generations of masters there has never been a bad or foolish 
      one, and in the end there has never been one who ranked second or third 
      among the daimyo of Japan. It is truly a wonderful clan; this is due to 
      the faith of its founders. Moreover, they did not send the clan's retainers 
      to other provinces. nor did they invite men from other provinces in. Men 
      who were made ronin were kept within the province, as were the descendants 
      of those who were made to commit seppuku. The wonder of being born into 
      a clan with such a deep pledge between master and servant is an inexpressible 
      blessing, passed down through the apes, for both farmer and townsman. This 
      goes without saying for the retainer .<br>
      The foundation of a Nabeshima samurai should be in knowing this fact; in 
      being deeply resolved to return this blessing by being useful ; in serving 
      more and more selflessly when treated kindly by the master ; in knowing 
      that being made a ronin or being ordered to commit seppuku are also forms 
      of service ; and in aiming to be mindful of the clan forever, whether one 
      is banished deep in the mountains or buried under the earth. Although it 
      is unfitting for someone like me to say this, in dying it is my hope not 
      to become a Buddha. Rather, my will is permeated with the resolution to 
      help manage the affairs of the province, though I be reborn as a Nabeshima 
      samurai seven times. One needs neither vitality nor talent. In a word, it 
      is a matter of having the will to shoulder the clan by oneself.<br>
      <br>
      How can one human being be inferior to another? In all matters of discipline, 
      one will be useless unless he has great pride. Unless one is determined 
      to move the clan by himself, all his discipline will come to naught. Although, 
      like a tea kettle, it is easy for one's enthusiasm to cool, there is a way 
      to keep this from happening. My own vows are the following:<br>
    <p align=justify>&nbsp;
  </div>
  </font></div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="CENTER"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#D8CCB8">
    <div align="justify"> Never to be outdone in the Way of the Samurai.<br>
      To be of good use to the master.<br>
      To be filial to my parents.<br>
      To manifest great compassion, and to act for the sake of Man. </div>
    </font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="CENTER"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#D8CCB8">
  <div align="justify">
    <p>If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, 
      he will have the strength of two men and will never slip backward. One must 
      edge forward like the inchworrn, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, 
      first started with a vow. </p>
