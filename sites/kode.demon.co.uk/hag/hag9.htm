    Shimomura Shoun was on service at the castle, Lord Naoshige said, "How wonderful 
    it is that Katsushige is so vigorous and powerful for his age. In wrestling 
    with his peers he even beat those who are older than he is."<br>
    Shoun replied, "Even though I'm an old man, I'll bet I'm best at seated wrestling." 
    So saying, he jerked up Katsushige and threw him so forcefully that it hurt. 
    He then said, "To be prideful about your strength while your mettle is not 
    yet established is likely to bring you shame in the midst of people. You are 
    weaker than you look.'' Then he withdrew. </font> </p>
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
    the time when Matsuda Yohei was an intimate friend of Ishii Jinku's, there 
    developed some bad feeling's between the former and Nozoe Jinbei. Yohei sent 
    word to Jinbei saying, "Please come and I will settle this matter once and 
    for all." Then he and Jinku set out together and, coming to the Yamabushi 
    mansion at Kihara, they crossed the only bridge there was and destroyed it. 
    Talking over the circumstances of the discord, they examined them from all 
    sides and found no reason to fight. But when they decided to turn around and 
    go home, there was, of course, no bridge<br>
    While they were looking for an appropriate way of crossing the moat, the men 
    whom the two had challenged could be seen approaching stealthily. Yohei and 
    Jinku saw this and said, "We have passed the point of no return, and may as 
    well fight rather than be disgraced at a later date. " The battle lasted for 
    some time. Seriously wounded, Yohei fell down between two fields. Jinbei also 
    received a deep wound, and with blood flowing into his eyes was unable to 
    find Yohei. While Jinbei thus searched about blindly, Yohei was able to hold 
    him off from his prone position and in the end cut him down. But when he attempted 
    to deliver the finishing blow, having no strength left in his hand, he pierced 
    Jinbei's neck by pushing the sword with his foot.<br>
    At this point, friends arrived and accompanied Yohei back. After his wounds 
    healed he was ordered to commit seppuku. At that time he called his friend 
    Jinku, and they drank a farewell cup together. </font>

    Toemon of Shioda ran a wineshop for Nabeshima Kenmotsu. Lord Okura, the son 
    of Nabeshima Kai no kami, was a cripple and confined indoors in a place called 
    Mine. He harbored wrestlers and liked rowdies. The wrestlers would often go 
    to nearby villages and cause disturbances. One time they went to Toemon's 
    place, drank sake and talked unreasonably, bringing Toemon into an argument. 
    He met them with a halberd, but as there were two of them he was cut down.<br>
    His son, Kannosuke, was fifteen years old and was in the midst of studies 
    at the Jozeiji when he was informed of the incident. Galloping off, he took 
    a short sword about sixteen inches in length, joined combat with the two big 
    men, and in a short time finished them both off. Although Kannosuke received 
    thirteen wounds, he recovered. Later he was called Doko and is said to have 
    become very adept at massage. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
    is said that Tokunaga Kichizaemon repeatedly com- plained, "I've grown so 
    old that now, even if there were to be a battle, I wouldn't be able to do 
    anything. Still, I would like to die by galloping into the midst of the enemy 
    and being struck down and killed. It would be a shame to do nothing more than 
    to die in one's bed."<br>
    It is said that the priest Gyojaku heard this when he was an acolyte. Gyojaku's 
    master was the priest Yemen, who was Kichizaemon's youngest child. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
    Sagara Kyuma was requested to become a chief retainer, he said to Nabeshima 
    Heizaemon, "For some reason I have been increasingly well treated by the master 
    and now have been requested to take a high rank. Not having a good retainer, 
    my affairs are liable to be in disorder. It is my request that you give me 
    your retainer, Takase Jibusaemon." Heizaemon listened to him and consented, 
    saying, "It is very gratifying that you have kept an eye on my retainer. I 
    will therefore do as you ask."<br>
    But when he related this to Jibusaemon, the latter said, "I should reply directly 
    to Master Kyuma." He then went to Kyuma's place and talked with him. Jibusaemon 
    told Kyuma, "I know it is a great honor that you have thought well of me and 
    have made this request. But a retainer is a person who cannot change masters. 
    As you are of high rank, if I were to become your retainer my life would be 
    replete, but that repleteness would be a vexation to me. Because Her zaemon 
    is of low rank and is hard pressed, we live by eating cheap rice gruel. Yet 
    that is sweet enough. Please think this over.''<br>
    Kyuma was extremely impressed. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    certain man went of somewhere and on returning home late at night, found that 
    a strange man had slipped into the house and was committing adultery with 
    his wife. He thereupon killed the man. He then broke down a wall and propped 
    up a bale of rice, and by this arrangement submitted to the authorities that 
    he had killed a thief. Thus it went without mishap. After some time had passed 
    he divorced his wife and the affair was finished. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
    a certain person returned home from some place or other, he found his wife 
    committing adultery with a retainer in the bedroom. When he drew near the 
    two, his retainer fled through the kitchen. He then went into the bedroom 
    and slew his wife.<br>
    Calling the maidservant, he explained what had happened and said, "Because 
    this would bring shame to the children, it should be covered up as death by 
    illness and I will need considerable help. If you think that this is too much 
    for you, I may as well kill you too for your part in this serious crime.''<br>
    She replied, "If you will spare my life, I will go on as if I don't know anything. 
    " She rearranged the room and set out the corpse in its nightclothes. Then, 
    after sending a man to the doctor's place two or three times saying that there 
    was a sudden illness, they sent a last messenger saying that it was too late 
    and there was no longer any need to come. The wife's uncle was called in and 
    told about the illness, and he was convinced. The entire affair was passed 
    oft as death by illness, and to the end no one knew the truth. At a later 
    date the retainer was dismissed. This affair happened in Edo. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
    New Year's in the third year of Keicho at a place in Korea called Yolsan, 
    when the armies of the Ming appeared by the hundreds of thousands, the Japanese 
    troops were amazed and watched with bated breath. Lord Naoshige said, "Well, 
    well. That's a great number of men ! I wonder how many hundreds of thousands 
    there are?''<br>
    Jin'emon said, "In Japan, for something that's numberless we say 'as many 
    as the hairs on a three-year-old calf.' This would certainly live up to the 
    number of hairs on a three-year-old calf!" It is said that everybody laughed 
    and regained their spirits.<br>
    Later, Lord Katsushige was hunting at MI. Shiroishi and told Nakano Matabei 
    about this. ' 'Except for your father who spoke in such a way, there was no 
    one who said even a word .'' </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nakano 
    Jin'emon constantly said, "A person who serves when treated kindly by the 
    master is not a retainer. But one who serves when the master is being heartless 
    and unreasonable is a retainer. You should understand this principle well 
    .'' </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
    Yamamoto Jin'emon was eighty years old, he be- came ill. At one point, he 
    seemed to be on the verge of groaning, and someone said to him, "You'll feel 
    better if you groan. Go ahead. *' But he replied, "Such is not the case. The 
    name of Yamamoto Jin'emon is known by everyone, and I have shown up well throughout 
    a whole lifetime. To let people hear my groaning voice in my last moments 
    would never do." It is said that he did not let out a groan to the very end. 
    </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    certain son of Mori Monbei got into a fight and returned home wounded. Asked 
    by Monbei, "What did you do to your opponent?" his son replied, "I cut him 
    down."<br>
    When Monbei asked, "Did you deliver the coup de grace?" his son replied, "Indeed 
    I did."'<br>
    Then Monbei said, "You have certainly done well, and there is nothing to regret. 
    Now, even if you fled you would have to commit seppuku anyway. When your mood 
    improves, commit seppuku, and rather than die by another's hand, you can die 
    by your father's. " And soon after he performed kaishaku for his son. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    man in the same group as Aiura Genzaemon committed some nefarious deed, and 
    so the group leader gave him a note, condemning him to death, which was to 
    be taken to Genzaemon's place. Genzaemon perused the note and then said to 
    the man, "It says here that I should kill you, so I will do away with you 
    on the eastern bank. Previously you have practiced such things as swordsmanship 
    . . . . Now fight with all you've got."<br>
    The man replied, "I will do as you say," and with Genzaemon alone accompanying 
    him, they left the house. They had gone about twenty yards along the edge 
    of the moat when a retainer of Genzaernon's yelled out, "Hey, Hey!" from the 
    other side. As Genzaemon was turning around, the condemned man attacked him 
    with his sword. Genzaemon ducked backwards, drew his sword, and cut the man 
    down. He then returned home.<br>
    He put the clothes he had been wearing at that time into a chest and locked 
    them up, never showing them to anyone for the rest of his life. After he died 
    the clothes were examined, and it was seen that they were rent. This was told 
    by his son, Genzaemon. </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okubo 
    Doko is said to have remarked :<br>
    Everyone says that no masters of the arts will appear as the world comes to 
    an end. This is something that I cannot claim to understand. Plants such as 
    peonies, azaleas and camellias will be able to produce beautiful flowers, 
    end of the world or not. If men would give some thought to this fact, they 
    would understand. And if people took notice of the masters of even these times, 
    they would be able to say that there are masters in the various arts. But 
    people become imbued with the idea that the world has come to an end and no 
    longer put forth any effort. This is a shame. There is no fault in the times.

  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
    Fukahori Magoroku was still living as a dependent second son, he once went 
    hunting at Fukahori, and his retainer, mistaking him for a wild boar in the 
    darkness of the undergrowth, fired the rifle, wounding him in the knee and 
    causing him to fall from a great height. The retainer, greatly upset, stripped 
    himself to the waist and was about to commit seppuku. Magoroku said, "You 
    can cut your stomach open later. I don't feel well, so bring me some water 
    to drink." The retainer ran about and obtained some water for his master to 
    drink and in the process calmed down. After that the retainer was again about 
    to commit seppuku, but Magoroku forcibly stopped him. Upon returning they 
    checked in with the man on guard, and Magoroku asked his father, Kanzaemen, 
    to forgive the retainer.<br>
    Kanzaemon said to the retainer, "It was an unexpected mistake, so do not be 
    worried. There is no need for reservation. Continue with your work.'' </font> 
  <p align=justify><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    man by the name of Takagi got into an argument with three farmers in the neighborhood, 
    was soundly beaten out in the fields, and returned home. His wife said to 
    him, "Haven't you forgotten about the matter of death?" "Definitely not!" 
    he replied.<br>
    His wife then retorted, "At any rate, a man dies only once. Of the various 
    ways of dying -dying of disease, being cut down in battle, seppuku or being 
    beheaded--to die ignominiously would be a shame," and went outside. She soon 
    returned, carefully put the two children to bed, prepared some torches, dressed 
    herself for battle after nightfall, and then said, "When I went out to survey 
    the scene a bit earlier, it seemed that the three men went into one place 
    for a discussion. Now is the right time. Let's go quickly!" So saying, they 
    went out with the husband in the lead, burning torches and wearing short swords. 
    They broke into their opponents' place and dispersed them, both husband and 
    wife slashing about and killing two of the men and wounding the other. The 
    husband was later ordered to commit seppuku. </font></p>
