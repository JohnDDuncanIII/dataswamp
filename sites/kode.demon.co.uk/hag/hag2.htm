    <p align=justify>It is said that much sake, self-pride and luxury are to be 
      avoided by a samurai, There is no cause for anxiety when you are unhappy, 
      but when you become a little elated, these three things become dangerous. 
      Look at the human condition. It is unseemly for a person to become prideful 
      and extravagant when things are going well. Therefore, it is better to have 
      some unhappiness while one is still young, for if a person does not experience 
      some bitterness, his disposition will not settle down. A person who becomes 
      fatigued when unhappy is useless. 
    <p align=justify>Meeting with people should be a matter of quickly grasping 
      their temperament and reacting appropriately to this person and that. Especially 
      with an extremely argumentative person, after yielding considerably one 
      should argue him down with superior logic, but without sounding harsh, and 
      in a fashion that will allow no resentment to be left afterwards. This is 
      a function of both the heart and words. This was an opinion given by a priest 
      concerning personal encounters . 
    <p align=justify>Dreams are truthful manifestations. When I occasionally have 
      dreams of dying in battle or committing seppuku, if I brace myself with 
      courage, my frame of mind within the dream gradually changes.<br>
      This concerns the dream I had on the night of the twenty- seventh day of 
      the fifth month. 
    <p align=justify>If one were to say in a word what the condition of being 
      a samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and 
      soul to his master. And if one is asked what to do beyond this, it would 
      be to fit oneself inwardly with intelligence, humanity and courage.' The 
      combining of these three virtues may seem unobtainable to the ordinary person, 
      but it is easy. Intelligence is nothing more than discussing things with 
      others. Limitless wisdom comes from this. Humanity is something done for 
      the sake of others, simply comparing oneself with them and putting them 
      in the fore. Courage is gritting one' s teeth ; it is simply doing that 
      and pushing ahead, paying no attention to the circumstances. Anything that 
      seems above these three is not necessary to be known.<br>
      As for outward aspects, there are personal appearance, one's way of speaking 
      and calligraphy. And as all of these are daily matters, they improve by 
      constant practice. Basically, one should perceive their nature to be one 
      of quiet strength. If one has accomplished all these things, then he should 
      have a knowledge of our area's history and customs. After that he may study 
      the various arts as recreation. If you think it over, being a retainer is 
      simple. And these days, if you observe people who are even a bit useful, 
      you will see that they have accomplished these three outward aspects. 
    <p align=justify>A certain priest said that if one thoughtlessly crosses a 
      river of unknown depths and shallows, he will die in its currents without 
      ever reaching the other side or finishing his business. This is the same 
      as when one is indiscriminately eager in being a retainer without understanding 
      the customs of the times or the likes and dislikes of the master and, as 
      a result, is of no use and brings ruin upon himself. To try to enter the 
      good graces of the master is unbecoming. One should consider first stepping 
      back and getting some understanding of the depths and shallows and then 
      work without doing anything the master dislikes. 
    <p align=justify>If you attach a number of bags of cloves to your body, you 
      will not be affected by inclemency or colds. Some years ago Nakano Kazuma 
      returned to this province as a messenger by horse in the dead of winter, 
      and though he was an old man, he was not the least bit in pain. It is said 
      that that was because of his having used cloves. Furthermore, drinking a 
      decoction of the feces from a dappled horse is the way to stop bleeding 
      from an injury received by falling off a horse. 
    <p align=justify>A faultless person is one who withdraws from affairs. This 
      must be done with strength. 
    <p align=justify>There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of 
      the present moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. 
      If one fully understands the present moment, there will be nothing else 
      to do, and nothing else to pursue. Live being true to the single purpose 
      of the moment .<br>
      Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though he 
      thought it were somewhere else. No one seems to have noticed this fact. 
      But grasping this firmly, one must pile experience upon experience. And 
      once one has come to this understanding he will be a different person from 
      that point on, though he may not always bear it in mind.<br>
      When one understands this settling into single-mindedness well, his affairs 
      will thin out. Loyalty is also contained within this single-mindedness. 
    <p align=justify>It is said that what is called "the spirit of an ape' ' is 
      seine- thing to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates 
      is due to the world's coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does 
      not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same.<br>
      For this reason, although one would like to change today's world back to 
      the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it 
      is important to make the best out of every generation. This is the mistake 
      of people who are attached to past generations. They have no understanding 
      of this point.<br>
      On the other hand, people who only know the disposition of the present day 
      and dislike the ways of the past are too lax. 
    <p align=justify>Be true to the thought of the moment and avoid distraction. 
      Other than continuing to exert yourself, enter into nothing else, but go 
      to the extent of living single thought by single thought. 
    <p align=justify>The brave men of old times were for the most part rowdies. 
      As they were of the disposition to be out running amuck, their vitality 
      was strong and they were brave. When I had doubts about this and asked, 
      Tsunetomo said, "It is understandable that since their vitality was strong 
      they were generally rough and went about running amuck. These days rowdiness 
      is nonexistent because man's vitality has weakened. Vitality has fallen 
      behind, but man's character has improved. Valor is yet a different thing. 
      Although men have become gentle these days because of the lack of vitality, 
      this does not mean that they are inferior in being crazy to die. That has 
      nothing to do with vitality." 
    <p align=justify>Concerning the military tactics of Lord Naoshige, Ushida 
      Shoemon said that it was characteristic of his retainers to face a situation 
      with no previous knowledge of what was to happen, and for him to freely 
      bring everything to a finish by a single word. When he was at the point 
      of passing from this world, he said nothing, even when his chief retainers 
      came to see him. 
    <p align=justify>Once Lord Ieyasu gamed nothing in a battle, but in a later 
      judgment it was said, "Ieyasu is a general of great courage. Of his retainers 
      who died in battle, not one of them died with his back turned. They all 
      died facing the enemy lines." Since a warrior' s daily frame of mind is 
      manifested even after death, it is something that can bring shame to him. 
    <p align=justify>As Yasuda Ukyo said about offering up the last wine cup, 
      only the end of things is important. One's whole life should be like this. 
      When guests are leaving, the mood of being reluctant to say farewell is 
      essential. If this mood is lacking, one will appear bored and the day and 
      evening's conversation will disappear. In all dealings with people it is 
      essential to have a fresh approach. One should constantly give the impression 
      that he is doing something exceptional. It is said that this is possible 
      with but a little understanding. 
    <p align=justify>Our bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. 
      Existing where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase, "Form is emptiness." 
      That all things are provided for by nothingness is the meaning of the phrase, 
      "Emptiness is form."' One should not think that these are two separate things 
      . 
    <p align=justify>Uesugi Kenshin said, "I never knew about winning from beginning 
      to end, but only about not being behind in a situation." This is interesting. 
      A retainer will be dumbfounded if he is behind in a situation. In each and 
      every instance one's function or responsiveness will not be shallow if he 
      is not behind . 
    <p align=justify>One should be wary of talking on end about such subjects 
      as learning, morality or folklore in front of elders or people of rank. 
      It is disagreeable to listen to. 
    <p align=justify>In the Kamigata area they have a sort of tiered lunch box 
      they use for a single day when flower viewing. Upon returning, they throw 
      them away, trampling them underfoot. As might be expected, this is one of 
      my recollections of the capital [Kyoto]. The end is important in all things. 
    <p align=justify>While walking along the road together, Tsunetomo said, "Is 
      not man like a well-operated puppet? It is a piece of dexterous workmanship 
      that he can run, jump, leap, and even talk though there are no strings attached. 
      Will we not be guests at next year's Ben Festival? This world is vanity 
      indeed. People always forget this." 
    <p align=justify>It was once said to one of the young lords that "right now'' 
      is ''at that time, '' and ''at that time'' is ''right now.'' One will miss 
      the occasion if he thinks that these two are different. For example, if 
      one were called before the master to explain something right away, he would 
      most likely be perplexed. This is proof that he understands the two to be 
      different. If, however, a person makes "right now" and "at that time" one, 
      though he will never be an advisor to the master, still he is a retainer, 
      and in order to be able to say something clearly, whether it be in front 
      of the master, the elders or even the shogun at Edo Castle, it should be 
      practiced beforehand in the corner of one's bedroom.<br>
      All things are like this. Accordingly, one should inquire into things carefully. 
      It is the same for martial training as for official business. When one attempts 
      to concentrate things in this manner, won't daily negligence and today's 
      lack of resolve be understood? 
    <p align=justify>Even though one has made some blunder in governmental work, 
      it can probably be excused by pleading clumsiness or inexperience. But what 
      kind of excuse may be given for the failure of the men who were involved 
      in this recent unexpected event?" Master Jin'emon always used to say, "It 
      is enough if a warrior is simply a stalwart," and this is just such a case. 
      If one felt that such a failure were a mortification, it would be the least 
      he could do to cut open his stomach, rather than live on in shame with a 
      burning in his breast and the feeling that he had no place to go, and, as 
      his luck as a warrior had run out, he was no longer able to function quickly 
      and had been given a bad name. But if one regretted losing his life and 
      reasoned that he should live because such a death would be useless, then 
      for the next five, ten or twenty years of his life, he would be pointed 
      at from behind and covered with shame. After his death his corpse would 
      be smeared with disgrace, his guiltless descendants would receive his dishonor 
      for having been born in his line, his ancestors' name would be dragged down, 
      and all the members of his family would be blemished. Such circumstances 
      are truly regrettable.<br>
      If one has no earnest daily intention, does not consider what it is to be 
      a warrior even in his dreams, and lives through the day idly, he can be 
      said to be worthy of punishment.<br>
      Presumably it can be said that a man who has been cut down was lacking in 
      ability and had run out of luck as a warrior. The man who cut him down, 
      compelled by unavoidable circumstances and feeling that there was nothing 
      else to be done, also put his life on the line, and thus there should be 
      no evidence of cowardice. Being short-tempered is inappropriate, but it 
      cannot be said that two men who face each other are cowards. In this recent 
      event, however, the men who lived and covered themselves with shame were 
      not true warriors .<br>
      One should every day think over and make an effort to implant in his mind 
      the saying, "At that time is right now." It is said that it is strange indeed 
      that anyone is able to pass through life by one means or another in negligence. 
      Thus, the Way of the Samurai is, morning after morning, the practice of 
      death, considering whether it will be here or be there, imagining the most 
      sightly way of dying, and putting one's mind firmly in death. Although this 
      may be a most difficult thing, if one will do it, it can be done. There 
      is nothing that one should suppose cannot be done.<br>
      Moreover, the influence of words is important in military affairs. It would 
      have been best for stopping the man in this recent event, too. When the 
      situation is too much, one may either cut the man down, or, if the man is 
      escaping, yell something like, "Don't run I Only cowards run !" and thus, 
      according to what the situation demands, achieve one's goals by the influence 
      of words. There was a certain man who was said to be good at judging men's 
      dispositions and formerly had everyone's attention, and he was able to handle 
      such cases. This is proof that "right now" is no different from "when the 
      time comes." The position of yokoza no yari is another example of this .* 
      It is something that should be made one's aim beforehand.<br>
      The things to be deeply considered beforehand are many. If there is someone 
      who has killed a man in the lord's mansion and has managed to escape, as 
      one does not know whether he may still be swinging his sword and advancing 
      toward the room next to the lord's, he should cut the man down. Indeed, 
      one may be blamed later in an investigation as a confederate of the killer, 
      or as someone who had a grudge against him. But at that time one should 
      think only of cutting the man down and not anticipate later blame. 
    <p align=justify>Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should 
      be able to do one more action with certainty. The last moments of Nitta 
      Yoshisada are proof of this . Had his spirit been weak, he would have fallen 
      the moment his head was severed. Recently, there is the example of Ono Doken. 
      These actions occurred because of simple determination. With martial valor, 
      if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though 
      his head is cut off, he should not die. 
    <p align=justify>Whether people be of high or low birth, rich or poor, old 
      or young, enlightened or confused, they are all alike in that they will 
      one day die. It is not that we don't know that we are going to die, but 
      we grasp at straws. While knowing that we will die someday, we think that 
      all the others will die before us and that we will be the last to go. Death 
      seems a long way oft .<br>
      Is this not shallow thinking? It is worthless and is only a joke within 
      a dream. It will not do to think in such a way and be negligent. insofar 
      as death is always at one's door, one should make sufficient effort and 
      act quickly. 
    <p align=justify>It is good to carry some powdered rouge in one's sleeve. 
      It may happen that when one is sobering up or waking from sleep, his complexion 
      may be poor. At such a time it is good to take out and apply some powdered 
      rouge. 
    <p align=justify>There are times when a person gets carried away and talks 
      on without thinking much. But this can be seen by observers when one's mind 
      is flippant and lacking truth. After such an occasion it is best to come 
      face to face with the truth and express it. The truth will then be arrived 
      at in one's own heart too. Even when greeting someone lightly, one should 
      consider the circumstances and after deliberation speak in a way that will 
      not injure the man's feelings.<br>
      Furthermore, if there is a person who is criticizing the Way of the Samurai 
      or one's own province, one should speak with him severely, without the least 
      bit of ceremony. One must be resolved in advance. 
    <p align=justify>Although a person who excels in an art regards others as 
      competitors, last year Hyodo Sachu gave up the title of Master of Renga 
      to Yamaguchi Shochin. A praiseworthy act. 
    <p align=justify>The priest Tannen used to hang up wind-bells but said, "It's 
      not because I like the sound. I hang them in order to know the wind conditions 
      in the event of fire, for that is the only worry in having a large temple." 
      When the wind blew, he himself walked about at night. Throughout his whole 
      life the fire in his brazier was never out, and he always put a paper lantern 
      and lighter by his pillow. He said, ' 'People are flustered during an emergency, 
      and there is no one to quickly strike a light." 
    <p align=justify>If one makes a distinction between public places and one's 
      sleeping quarters, or between being on the battlefield and on the tatami, 
      when the moment comes there will not be time for making amends. There is 
      only the matter of constant awareness. If it were not for men who demonstrate 
      valor on the tatami, one could not find them on the battlefield either. 
    <p align=justify>Bravery and cowardice are not things that can be conjectured 
      in times of peace. They are in different categories. 
    <p align=justify>Though it may be said that the gods dislike impurity, if 
      one thinks a bit, he will see that he has not been negligent in his daily 
      worship. Thus, one's previous faithfulness has been exactly for the sake 
      of praying for good fortune in such times as when one is barbed in blood 
      and climbing over the dead. At such a time, if it is a god that turns back 
      when one is defiled, then one should know clearly that praying is ineffective 
      and should worship regardless of defilement. 
    <p align=justify>At times of great trouble or disaster, one word will suffice. 
      At times of happiness, too, one word will be enough. And when meeting or 
      talking with others, one word will do. One should think well and then speak. 
      This is clear and firm, and one should learn it with no doubts. It is a 
      matter of putting forth one's whole effort and having the correct attitude 
      previously. This is very difficult to explain but is something that everyone 
      should work on in his heart. If a person has not learned this in his heart, 
      it is not likely that he will understand it. 
    <p align=justify>Human life is truly a short affair. It is better to live 
      doing the things that you like. It is foolish to live within this dream 
      of a world seeing unpleasantness and doing only things that you do not like. 
      But it is important never to tell this to young people as it is something 
      that would be harmful if incorrectly understood.<br>
      Personally, I like to sleep. And I intend to appropriately confine myself 
      more and more to my living quarters and pass my life away sleeping. 
    <p align=justify>I had a dream on the night of the twenty-eighth day of the 
      twelfth month in the third year of Shotoku. The content of the dream changed 
      gradually to the extent that I strengthened my will. The condition of a 
      person is revealed by his dreams. It would be good to make companions of 
      your dreams and to put forth effort. 
    <p align=justify>Shame and repentance are like upsetting a pot of water. When 
      a certain friend of mine listened to the way that a man who had stolen his 
      sword ornament confessed, he felt compassion. If one will rectify his mistakes, 
      their traces will soon disappear. 
    <p align=justify>According to what the Buddhist priest Kaion said, a person 
      becomes more and more prideful if he gains a little understanding because 
      he thinks he knows his own limits and weak points. However, it is a difficult 
      thing to truly know one's own limits and weak points. 
    <p align=justify>At a glance, every individual's own measure of dignity is 
      manifested just as it is. There is dignity in personal appearance. There 
      is dignity in a calm aspect. There is dignity in a paucity of words. There 
      is dignity in flawlessness of manners. There is dignity in solemn behavior. 
      And there is dignity in deep insight and a clear perspective.<br>
      These are all reflected on the surface. But in the end, their foundation 
      is simplicity of thought and tautness of spirit. 
    <p align=justify>Covetousness, anger and foolishness are things to sort out 
      well. When bad things happen in the world, if you look at them comparatively, 
      they are not unrelated to these three things. Looking comparatively at the 
      good things, you will see that they are not excluded from wisdom, humanity 
      and bravery . 
    <p align=justify>This is according to what Nakano Kazuma Toshiaki said. There 
      are people who feel that using old utensils for the Tea Ceremony is coarse, 
      and that it is better to use new, clean utensils. There are also people 
      who are wont to use old materials because of their lack of gaudiness. Both 
      are mistaken. Old utensils, although they are things that are used by the 
      humble, are also used by the higher classes because of their value. Their 
      value is revered.<br>
      A retainer is just like this. A person rises from the humble to the higher 
      classes because he has value. At the same time, to feel that a person of 
      no family cannot do the same work as one of higher family, or that a man 
      who has heretofore been only a foot soldier should not be allowed to become 
      a leader, is entirely wrong thinking. As for a person who has risen from 
      the humble, his value should be prized and especially respected, even more 
      than that of a person who was born into his class. 
    <p align=justify>My father Jin'emon said that when he was young he was taken 
      from time to time to the entrance of the Chinese settlement in order to 
      be exposed to the atmosphere of the city and to become used to people. From 
      the time he was five years old he was sent as family representative to various 
      people's homes, and in order to make him strong he was made to put on a 
      warrior's straw sandals and visit the temples of his ancestors from the 
      time he was seven. 
    <p align=justify>It is said that one will not be able to do great works if 
      he does not behave with some reserve towards his master, the chief retainers 
      and elders. What is done casually and freely will not work out well. It 
      is a matter of attitude. 
    <p align=justify>It is unfitting that one be ignorant of the history and origins 
      of his clan and its retainers. But there are times when extensive knowledge 
      becomes a hindrance. One should use discretion. Knowing the circumstances 
      can be an obstruction in everyday affairs, too. One should use discretion. 
    <p align=justify>It is written that the priest Shungaku said, "In just refusing 
      to retreat from something one gains the strength of two men." This is interesting. 
      Something that is not done at that time and at that place will remain unfinished 
      for a lifetime. At a time when it is difficult to complete matters with 
      the strength of a single man, one will bring it to a conclusion with the 
      strength of two. If one thinks about it later, he will be negligent all 
      his life.<br>
      "Stamp quickly and pass through a wall of iron" is another interesting phrase. 
      To quickly break in and stamp through directly is the first step of celerity. 
      In connection with this, Hideyoshi can be thought of as the only man who 
      has grasped solidly the chance of a lifetime since the creation of Japan. 
    <p align=justify>People who talk on and on about matters of little importance 
      probably have some complaint in the back of their mind. But in order to 
      be ambiguous and to hide this they repeat what they are saving over and 
      over. To hear something like this causes doubt to arise in one's breast. 
    <p align=justify>One should be careful and not say things that are likely 
      to cause trouble at the time. When some difficulty arises in this world, 
      people get excited, and before one knows it the matter is on everyone's 
      lips. This is useless. If worse comes to worse, you may become the subject 
      of gossip, or at least you will have made enemies by saying somethinp unnecessary 
      and will have created ill will. It is said that at such a time it is better 
      to stay at home and think of poetry. 
    <p align=justify>To tallc about other people's affairs is a great mistake. 
      To praise them, too, is unfttting. In any event, it is best to know your 
      own ability well, to put forth effort in your endeavors, and to be discreet 
      in speech. 
    <p align=justify>The heart of a virtuous person has settled down and he does 
      not rush about at things. A person of little merit is not at peace but walks 
      about making trouble and is in conflict with all. 
    <p align=justify>It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When 
      you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself 
      that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a 
      bit different from this. 
    <p align=justify>People with intelligence will use it to fashion things both 
      true and false and will try to push through whatever they want with their 
      clever reasoning. This is injury from intelligence . Nothing you do will 
      have effect if you do not use truth. 
    <p align=justify>In affairs like law suits or even in arguments, by losing 
      quickly one will lose in fine fashion. It is like sumo [wrestling]. If one 
      thinks only of winning, a sordid victory will be worse than a defeat. For 
      the most part, it becomes a squalid defeat. 
    <p align=justify>Feeling deeply the difference between oneself and others, 
      bearing ill will and falling out with people--these things come from a heart 
      that lacks compassion. If one wraps up everything with a heart of compassion, 
      there will be no coming into conflict with people. 
    <p align=justify>A person who knows but a little will put on an air of knowledpe. 
      This is a matter of inexperience. When someone knows something well, it 
      will not be seen in his manner. This person is genteel. 
    <p align=justify>When going someplace for a talk or something similar, it 
      is best to let the person know ahead of time, and then go. To go without 
      knowing whether the other party is busy, or when he has some particular 
      anxiety, is awkward. There is nothing that surpasses not going where you 
      have not been invited. Good friends are rare. Even if someone is invited 
      somewhere, he should use understanding. It is difficult to feel deeply the 
      sensitivities of people other than those who go out only rarely. Fiascos 
      at pleasure gatherings are numerous .<br>
      However, you should not be brusque towards a person who has come to visit, 
      even if you are busy. 
    <p align=justify>It is bad to carry even a good thing too far. Even concerning 
      things such as Buddhism, Buddhist sermons, and moral lessons, talking too 
      much will bring harm. 
    <p align=justify>The late Jin'emon said that it is better not to bring up 
      daughters. They are a blemish to the family name and a shame to the parents. 
      The eldest daughter is special, but it is better to disregard the others. 
    <p align=justify>The priest Keiho related that Lord Aki once said that martial 
      valor is a matter of becoming a fanatic. I thought that this was surprisingly 
      in accord with my own resolve and thereafter became more and more extreme 
      in my fanaticism. 
    <p align=justify>The late Nakano Kazuma said that the original purpose of 
      the Tea Ceremony is to cleanse the six senses. For the eyes there are the 
      hanging scroll and flower arrangement. For the nose there is the incense. 
      For the ears there is the sound of the hot water. For the mouth there is 
      the taste of the tea. And for the hands and feet there is the correctness 
      of term. When the five senses have thus been cleansed, the mind will of 
      itself be purified. The Tea Ceremony will cleanse the mind when the mind 
      is clogged up. I do not depart from the heart of the Tea Ceremony for twenty-four 
      hours a day, yet this is absolutely not a matter of tasteful living. Moreover, 
      the tea utensils are something that should be in accord with one's social 
      position.<br>
      In the poem, "Under the deep snows in the last village/ Last night numerous 
      branches of plum blossomed," the opulence of the phrase "numerous branches" 
      was changed to "a single branch." It is said that this "single branch" contains 
      true tranquillity. 
    <p align=justify>When intimate friends, allies, or people who are indebted 
      to you have done some wrong, you should secretly reprimand them and intervene 
      between them and society in a good manner. You should erase a person's bad 
      reputation and praise him as a matchless ally and one man in a thousand. 
      If you wilt thus reprimand a person in private and with good understanding, 
      his blemish will heal and he will become good. If you praise a person, people's 
      hearts will change and an ill reputation will go away of itself. It is important 
      to have the single purpose of handling all things with compassion and doing 
      things well. 
    <p align=justify>A certain person said the following.<br>
      There are two kinds of dispositions, inward and outward, and a person who 
      is lacking in one or the other is worthless. It is, for example, like the 
      blade of a sword, which one should sharpen well and then put in its scabbard, 
      periodically taking it out and knitting one's eyebrows as in an attack, 
      wiping f the blade, and then placing it in its scabbard again .<br>
      If a person has his sword out all the time, he is habitually swinging a 
      naked blade ; people will not approach him and he will have no allies.<br>
      If a sword is always sheathed, it will become rusty, the blade will dull, 
      and people will think as much of its owner. 
    <p align=justify>One cannot accomplish things simply with cleverness. One 
      must take a broad view. It will not do to make rash judgments concerning 
      good and evil. However, one should not be sluggish. It is said that one 
      is not truly a samurai if he does not make his decisions quickly and break 
      right through to completion. 
    <p align=justify>Once, when a group of five or six pages were traveling to 
      the capital together in the same boat, it happened that their boat struck 
      a regular ship late at night. Five or six seamen from the ship leapt aboard 
      and loudly demanded that the pages give up their boat's anchor, in accord 
      with the seaman's code. Hearing this, the pages ran forward yelling, "The 
      seaman's code is something for people like you! Do you think that we samurai 
      are going to let you take equipment from a boat carrying warriors? We will 
      cut you down and throw you into the sea to the last man !" With that, all 
      the seamen fled back to their own ship.<br>
      At such a time, one must act like a samurai. For trifling occasions it is 
      better to accomplish things simply by yelling. By making something more 
      significant than it really is and missing one's chance, an affair will not 
      be brought to a close and will be no accomplishment at all. 
    <p align=justify>A certain person who came up with a cash shortage when closing 
      out an account book sent a letter to his section leader saying, "It is regrettable 
      to have to commit seppuku over a matter of money. As you are my section 
      leader, please send some funds." Since this was reasonable, the balance 
      was provided and the matter was closed. It is said that even wrongdoings 
      can be managed without detection. 
    <p align=justify>By being impatient, matters are damaged and great works cannot 
      be done. If one considers something not to be a matter of time, it will 
      be done surprisingly quickly. Times change. Think about the world fifteen 
      years from now. It should be rather different, but if one were to look into 
      a book of prophecies, I imagine that it would not be that different. In 
      the passing fifteen years, not one of the useful men of today will be left. 
      And even if men who are young now come forth, probably less than half will 
      make it. Worth gradually wanes. For example, if there were a shortage of 
      gold, silver would become treasure, and if there were a shortage of silver, 
      copper would be valued. With changing times and the waning of men's capacities, 
      one would be of suitable worth even if he put forth only slight effort. 
      Something like fifteen years is the space of a dream. If a man but takes 
      care of his health, in the end he will have accomplished his purpose and 
      will be a valuable person. Certainly in a period when masters are many, 
      one must put forth considerable effort. But at the time when the world is 
      sliding into a decline, to excel is easy. 
    <p align=justify>To put forth great effort in correcting a person's bad habits 
      is the way it should be done. One should be like the digger wasp. It is 
      said that even with an adopted child, if you teach him continually so that 
      he will resemble you, he surely will. 
    <p align=justify>If your strength is only that which comes from vitality, 
      your words and personal conduct will appear to be in accord with the Way, 
      and you will be praised by others. But when you question yourself about 
      this, there will be nothing to be said. The last line of the poem that goes, 
      "When your own heart asks," is the secret principle of all the arts. It 
      is said that it is a good censor. 
    <p align=justify>When you are listening to the stories of accomplished men 
      and the like, you should listen with deep sincerity, even if it's something 
      about which you already know. If in listening to the same thing ten or twenty 
      times it happens that you come to an unexpected understanding, that moment 
      will be very special. Within the tedious talk of old folks are their meritorious 
      deeds. </p>
