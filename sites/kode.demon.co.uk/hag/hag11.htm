    <p align=center><font size="3" color="#33CC33">From the 11th Chapter</font> 
    <p align=justify>In the "Notes on Martial Laws" it is written that:<br>
      The phrase, ''Win first, fight later, '' can be summed up in the two words, 
      "Win beforehand." The resourcefulness of times of peace is the military 
      preparation for times of war. With five hundred allies one can defeat an 
      enemy force of ten thousand.<br>
      When advancing on the enemy's castle and then pulling back, do not retreat 
      by the main road, but rather by the side roads.<br>
      One should lay one's dead and wounded allies face down in the direction 
      of the enemy.<br>
      It is a matter of course that a warrior's attitude should be to be in the 
      vanguard during an attack and in the rear during a retreat. In approaching 
      for the attack he does not forget to wait for the right moment. In waiting 
      for the right moment he never forgets the attack. 
    <p align=justify>A helmet is usually thought to be very heavy, but when one 
      is attacking a castle or something similar, and arrows, bullets, large rocks, 
      great pieces of wood and the like are corning down, it will not seem the 
      least bit so. 
    <p align=justify>Once when Master Yagyu was before the shogun on some business, 
      a number of bamboo swords fell from the ceiling. He quickly clasped his 
      hands above his head and was not struck .<br>
      Again, at a certain time when he was summoned, the shogun was waiting behind 
      cover with a bamboo sword ready to strike him. Master Yagyu called out in 
      a loud voice, "This is for your own discipline. Don't look !" As the shogun 
      turned around, Master Yagyu stepped up and took the sword out of his hand. 
    <p align=justify>A person who does not want to be struck by the enemy s arrows 
      will have no divine protection. For a man who does not wish to be hit by 
      the arrows of a common soldier, but rather by those of a warrior of fame, 
      there will be the protection for which he has asked. 
    <p align=justify>Wind-bells are things that are used during campaigns in order 
      to know the direction of the wind. For night attacks, fire can be set windward 
      while the attack can be carried out from the opposite direction. Your allies 
      should be mindful of this also. One should always hang wind-bells in order 
      to know the direction of the wind. 
    <p align=justify>Lord Aki declared that he would not have his descendants 
      learn military tactics. He said, "On the battlefield, once discretion starts 
      it cannot be stopped. One will not break through to the enemy with discretion. 
      Indiscretion is most important when in front of the tiger's den. Therefore, 
      if one were informed of military tactics, he would have many doubts, and 
      there will be no end to the matter. My descendants will not practice military 
      tactics.' 
    <p align=justify>According to Lord Naoshige's words:<br>
      There is something to which every young samurai should pay attention. During 
      times of peace when listening to stories of battle, one should never say, 
      "In facing such a situation, what would a person do?" Such words are out 
      of the question. How will a man who has doubts even in his own room achieve 
      anything on the battlefield? There is a saying that goes, "No matter what 
      the circumstances might be, one should be of the mind to win. One should 
      be holding the first spear to strike." Even though you have put your life 
      on the line, there is nothing to be done when the situation doesn't go as 
      planned. 
    <p align=justify>Takeda Shingen once said, "If there was a man who could kill 
      Lord Ieyasu, I would give him a handsome reward." Hearing this, a boy of 
      thirteen entered into the service of Lord Ieyasu and one night when he saw 
      that Ieyasu had retired, took a stab at his bedding. Lord Ieyasu was actually 
      in the next room silently reading a sutra, but he quickly grabbed the boy.<br>
      When the investigation was held, the boy related the facts honestly, and 
      Lord Ieyasu said, "You seemed to be an excellent young man, so I employed 
      you on friendly terms. Now, however, I am even more impressed by you." He 
      then sent the lad back to Shingen. 
    <p align=justify>One night some samurai from Karatsu gathered together and 
      were playing go. Master Kitabatake was watching the game, and when he offered 
      a suggestion, one man attacked him with a sword. After the people around 
      them had stopped the man, Master Kitabatake pinched out the light of the 
      candle and said, "It was nothing more than my own indiscretion, and I apologize. 
      The sword hit the go case; I was not the least bit wounded."<br>
      Then the candle was relighted, but when the man came to reconciliate and 
      offer him a sake cup, Kitabatake cut the man's head off with one blow. Presently 
      he said, "My thigh having been cut through, it was difficult to offer any 
      resistance, but by binding my leg with my coat and supporting myself with 
      the go board, I have done this thing." Having said this, he expired. 
    <p align=justify>There is nothing so painful as regret. We would all like 
      to be without it. However, when we are very happy and become elated, or 
      when we habitually jump into something thoughtlessly, later we are distraught, 
      and it is for the most part because we did not think ahead and are now regretful. 
      Certainly we should try not to become dejected, and when very happy should 
      calm our minds. 
    <p align=justify>These are teachings of Yamamoto Jin'emon:<br>
      Singlemindedness is all-powerful.<br>
      Tether even a roasted chicken.<br>
      Continue to spur a running horse.<br>
      A man who will criticize you openly carries no connivance .<br>
      A man exists for a generation, but his name lasts to the end of time.<br>
      Money is a thing that will be there when asked for. A good man is not so 
      easily found.<br>
      Walk with a real man one hundred yards and he'll tell you at least seven 
      lies.<br>
      To ask when you already know is politeness. To ask when you don't know is 
      the rule.<br>
      Wrap your intentions in needles of pine.<br>
      One should not open his mouth wide or yawn in front of another. Do this 
      behind your fan or sleeve.<br>
      A straw hat or helmet should be worn tilled toward the front. 
    <p align=justify>It is a principle of the art of war that one should simply 
      lay down his life and strike. If one's opponent also does the same, it is 
      an even match. Defeating one's opponent is then a matter of faith and destiny.<br>
      One should not show his sleeping quarters to other people. The times of 
      deep sleep and dawning are very important. One should be mindful of this. 
      This is from a story by Nagahama lnosuke. 
    <p align=justify>When one departs for the front, he should carry rice in a 
      bag. His underwear should be made from the skin of a badger. This way he 
      will not have lice. In a long campaign, lice are troublesome.<br>
      When meeting with the enemy, there is a way to determine his strength. If 
      he has his head cast down, he will appear black and is strong. If he is 
      looking upward, he will appear white and is weak. This is from a story by 
      Natsume Toneri . 
    <p align=justify>If a warrior is not unattached to life and death, he will 
      be of no use whatsoever. The saying that "All abilities come from one mind" 
      sounds as though it has to do with sentient matters, but it is in fact a 
      matter of being unattached to life and death. With such non-attachment one 
      can accomplish any feat. Martial arts and the like are related to this insofar 
      as they can lead to the Way. 
    <p align=justify>To calm one's mind, one swallows his saliva. This is a secret 
      matter. When one becomes angry, it is the same. Putting spittle on one's 
      forehead is also good. In the Yoshida school of archery, swallowing one's 
      spittle is the secret principle of the art. 
    <p align=justify>A certain general said, "For soldiers other than officers, 
      if they would test their armor, they should test only the front. Furthermore, 
      while ornamentation on armor is unnecessary, one should be very careful 
      about the appearance of his helmet. It is something that accompanies his 
      head to the enemy's camp." 
    <p align=justify>Nakano Jin'emon said, "Learning such things as military tactics 
      is useless. If one does not strike out by simply closing his eyes and rushing 
      into the enemy, even if it is only one step, he will be of no use." This 
      was also the opinion of Iyanaga Sasuke. 
    <p align=justify>In Natsume Toneri's "Military Stories" it is written: "Look 
      at the soldiers of recent times ! Even in long battles there are hardly 
      one or two occasions when blood is washed with blood. One should not be 
      negligent." Toneri was a ronin from the Kamigata area. 
    <p align=justify>To have execution grounds in a place where travelers come 
      and go is useless. The executions in Edo and the Kamigala area are meant 
      to be an example for the whole country. But the executions in one province 
      are only for an example in that province. If crimes are many, it is a province's 
      shame. How would this look to other provinces?<br>
      With the passing of time, the criminal will forget the reason for his crime 
      ; it is best to execute him on the spot. 
    <p align=justify>Matsudaira Izu no kami said to Master Mizuno Kenmotsu, "You're 
      such a useful person, it's a shame that you're so short.''<br>
      Kenmotsu replied, "That's true. Sometimes things in this world don't go 
      the way we would like. Now if I were to cut off your head and attach it 
      to the bottom of my feet, I would be taller. But that's something that couldn't 
      be done." 
    <p align=justify>A certain person was passing by the town of Yae when suddenly 
      his stomach began to hurt. He stopped at a house on a side street and asked 
      to use the toilet. There was only a young woman there, but she took him 
      to the back and showed him where it was. Just as he was taking off his hakama 
      and going into the toilet, the woman's husband came home and accused them 
      both of adultery. In the end, it became a public matter.<br>
      Lord Naoshige heard the case and said, "Even if this is not a matter of 
      adultery, it is the same as adultery to take off one's hakama without hesitation 
      in a place where there is an unaccompanied woman, and in the woman's case 
      to allow someone to disrobe while her husband is absent from home .''<br>
      It is said that they were both condemned to death for this act. 
    <p align=justify>In assessing the enemy's castle there is a saying that goes, 
      "Smoke and mist are like looking at a spring mountain. After the rain is 
      like viewing a clear day." There is weakness in perfect clarity. 
    <p align=justify>Among the words spoken by great generals, there are some 
      that were said offhandedly. One should not receive these words in the same 
      manner, however. 
    <p align=justify>People who have an intelligent appearance will not be outstanding 
      even if they do something good, and if they do something normal, people 
      will think them lacking. But if a person who is thought of as having a gentle 
      disposition does even a slightly good thing, he will be praised by people. 
    <p align=justify>On the fourteenth day of the seventh month in the third year 
      of Shotoku, there were some cooks in the midst of preparations for the Ben 
      Festival in the outer citadel of the castle. One of them, Hara Jurozaemon, 
      unsheathed his sword and cut off the head of Sagara Genzaemon. Mawatari 
      Rokuuemon, Aiura Tarobei, Kola Kinbei and Kakihara Riemen all ran away in 
      confusion. When Jurozaemon sighted Kinbei and started chasing him, the latter 
      fled to the foot soldiers' gathering area. There, the daimyo's palanquin 
      attendant, Tanaka Takeuemon, stood against Jurozaemon and took away his 
      still drawn sword. Ishirnaru San'emon chased Jurozaemon, and when they came 
      to the foot soldiers' area, assisted Takeuemon.<br>
      The punishment was given on the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month in 
      the same year. Jurozaemon was bound with rope and beheaded. Rokuuemon, Tarobei, 
      Kinbei and Riemon were banished, and San'emon was ordered to retire. Takeuemon 
      was rewarded with three pieces of silver.<br>
      It was later said that Takeuemon had been slow to act, for he had not bound 
      the man at that time. 
    <p align=justify>Among Takeda Shingen's retainers there were men of matchless 
      courage, but when Katsuyori was killed in the fight at Tenmokuzan, they 
      all fled. Tsuchiya Sozo, a warrior who had been in disfavor for many years, 
      came out alone, however, and said, "I wonder where all the men are who spoke 
      so bravely every day? I shall return the master's favors to me." And he 
      fell alone in battle. 
    <p align=justify>The essentials of speaking are in not speaking at all. If 
      you think that you can finish something without speaking, finish it without 
      saying a single word. If there is something that cannot be accomplished 
      without speaking, one should speak with few words, in a way that will accord 
      well with reason .<br>
      To open one's mouth indiscriminately brings shame, and there are many times 
      when people will turn their backs on such a person. 
    <p align=justify>A devotee of the Nembutsu recites the Buddha's name with 
      every incoming and outgoing breath in order never to forget the Buddha. 
      A retainer, too, should be just like this in thinking of his master. Not 
      to forget one's master is the most fundamental thing for a retainer. 
    <p align=justify>Men who did well at the time of their death were men of real 
      bravery. There are many examples of such. But people who talk in an accomplished 
      fashion every day yet are agitated at the time of their death can be known 
      not to have true bravery . 
    <p align=justify>In the secret principles of Yagyu Tajima no kami Munenori 
      there is the saying, "There are no military tactics for a man of great strength." 
      As proof of this, there was once a certain vassal of the shogun who came 
      to Master Yagyu and asked to become a disciple. Master Yagyu said, "You 
      seem to be a man who is very accomplished in some school of martial art. 
      Let us make the master-disciple contract after I learn the name of the school."<br>
      But the man replied, "I have never practiced one of the martial arts."<br>
      Master Yagyu said, "Have you come to make sport of Tajima no kami ? Is my 
      perception amiss in thinking that you are a teacher to the shogun?" But 
      the man swore to it and Master Yagyu then asked, "That being so, do you 
      not have some deep conviction?"<br>
      The man replied, "When I was a child, I once became suddenly aware that 
      a warrior is a man who does not hold his life in regret. Since I have held 
      that in my heart for many years, it has become a deep conviction, and today 
      I never think about death. Other than that I have no special conviction.''<br>
      Master Yagyu was deeply impressed and said, "My perceptions were not the 
      least bit awry. The deepest principle of my military tactics is just that 
      one thing. Lip until now , among all the many hundreds of disciples I have 
      had, there is not one who is licensed in this deepest principle. It is not 
      necessary for you to take up the wooden sword. I will initiate you right 
      now.'' And it is said that he promptly banded him the certified scroll.<br>
      This is a story of Muragawa Soden's. 
    <p align=justify>Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. 
      Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon 
      being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away 
      by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck 
      by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from 
      thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death 
      of one's master. And every day without fail one should consider himself 
      as dead.<br>
      There is a saying of the elders' that goes, "Step from under the eaves and 
      you're a dead man. Leave the gate and the enemy is waiting." This is not 
      a matter of being careful. It is to consider oneself as dead beforehand. 
    <p align=justify>People will become your enemies if you become eminent too 
      quickly in life, and you will be ineffectual. Rising slowly in the world, 
      people will be your allies and your happiness will he assured.<br>
      In the long run, whether you are fast or slow, as long as you have people's 
      understanding there will be no danger. It is said that fortune that is urged 
      upon you from others is the most effective. 
    <p align=justify>The warriors of old cultivated mustaches, for as proof that 
      a man had been slain in battle, his ears and nose would be cut off and brought 
      to the enemy's camp. So that there would be no mistake as to whether the 
      person was a man or a woman, the mustache was also cut off with the nose. 
      At such a time the head was thrown away if it had no mustache, for it might 
      be mistaken for that of a woman. Therefore, growing a mustache was one of 
      the disciplines of a samurai so that his head would not be thrown away upon 
      his death. Tsunetomo said, "If one washes his face with water every morning, 
      if he is slain his complexion will not change. " 
    <p align=justify>The word "person of the north" comes from a tradition of 
      the correct way of upbringing. A couple will put their pillows in the west, 
      and the man, lying on the south side, will face the north, while the woman, 
      lying on the north side, will face the south. 
    <p align=justify>In bringing up a boy, one should first encourage a sense 
      of valor. From the time he is young the child should liken his parents to 
      the master, and learn everyday politeness and etiquette, the serving of 
      other people, the ways of speech, forbearance and even the correct way of 
      walking down the street. The elders were taught in the same fashion. When 
      he does not put effort into things, he should be scolded and made to go 
      the entire day without eating. This is also one of the disciplines of a 
      retainer.<br>
      As for a girl, it is most important to teach her chastity from the time 
      she is a child. She should not be in the comany of a man at a distance of 
      less than six feet, nor should she meet them eye to eye, nor should she 
      receive things from them directly from hand to hand. Neither should she 
      go sight-seeing or take trips to temples. A woman who has been brought up 
      strictly and has endured suffering at her own borne will suffer no ennui 
      after she is married.<br>
      In dealing with younger children one should use rewards and punishments. 
      If one is lax in being sure that they do as they are told, young children 
      will become self-interested and will later be involved in wrongdoings. It 
      is something about which one should be very careful. </p>
