    <p align=justify>When Nabeshima Tadanao was fifteen years old, a manservant 
      in the kitchen committed some rude act and a foot soldier was about to beat 
      him, but in the end the servant cut the soldier down. The clan elders deemed 
      the death sentence appropriate, saying that the man had in the first place 
      erred in matters concerning the ranks of men, and that he had also shed 
      the blood of his opponent. Tadanao heard this and said, "Which is worse, 
      to err in matters concerning the ranks of men or to stray from the Way of 
      the Samurai ?''<br>
      The elders were unable to answer. Then Tadanao said, "I have read that when 
      the crime itself is unclear, the punishment should be light. Put him in 
      confinement for a while." 
    <p align=justify>Once, when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Shiroishi, he shot 
      a large boar. Everyone came running up to see it and said, "Well, well. 
      You have brought down an uncommonly large one !" Suddenly the boar got up 
      and dashed into their midst. All of them fled in confusion, but Nabeshima 
      Matabet drew his sword and finished it off. At that point Lord Katsushige 
      covered his face with his sleeve and said, "It sure is dusty." This was 
      presumably because he did not want to see the spectacle of his flustered 
      men. 
    <p align=justify>When Lord Katsushige was young, he was instructed by his 
      father, Lord Naoshige, "For practice in cutting, execute some men who have 
      been condemned to death." Thus, in the place that is now within the western 
      gate, ten men were lined up, and Katsushige continued to decapitate one 
      after another until he had executed nine of them. When he came to the tenth, 
      he saw that the man was young and healthy and said, "I'm tired of cutting 
      now. I'll spare this man's life." And the man's life was saved. 
    <p align=justify>Lord Katsushige always used to say that there are four kinds 
      of retainers. They are the "quick, then lagging," the "lagging, then quick," 
      the "continually quick," and the ''continually lagging.''<br>
      The "continually quick" are men who when given orders will undertake their 
      execution quickly and settle the matter well. Fukuchi Kichizaemon and the 
      like resemble this type.<br>
      The "lagging, then quick" are men who, though lacking in understanding when 
      given orders, prepare quickly and bring the matter to a conclusion. I suppose 
      that Nakano Kazuma and men similar are like this.<br>
      The "quick, then lagging" are men who when given orders seem to be going 
      to settle things but in their preparation take time and procrastinate. There 
      are many people like this.<br>
      Other than these, one could say that the rest are ''continually lagging."
