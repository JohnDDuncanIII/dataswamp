    <p align=justify>Narutomi Hyogo said, "What is called winning is defeaing 
      one's allies. Defeating one's allies is defeating oneself, and defeating 
      oneself is vigorously overcoming one's own body.<br>
      "It is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand allies but not 
      a one were following him. If one hasn't previously mastered his mind and 
      body, he will not defeat the enemy.'' 
    <p align=justify>During the Shimabara Rebellion, his armor being still at 
      the encampment, Shugyo Echizen no kami Tanenao participated in the fight 
      dressed only in hakama and haori. It is said that he died in battle in this 
      attire. 
    <p align=justify>At the time of the attack on the castle at Shimabara, Tazaki 
      Geki was wearing very resplendent armor. Lord Katsushige was not pleased 
      by this, and after that every time he saw something showy he would say, 
      "That's just like Geki's armor.''<br>
      In the light of this story, military armor and equipment that are showy 
      can be seen as being weak and having no strength. By them one can see through 
      the wearer's heart. 
    <p align=justify>When Nabeshima wizen no kami Tadanao died, his attendant 
      Ezoe Kinbei took his remains and had them consecrated at Mt. Kola. Then, 
      confining himself in a hermitage, he carved a statue of his master and another 
      of himself doing reverence before the master. On the first anniversary of 
      Tadanao's death, he returned to his home and committed tsuifuku. Later the 
      statue was taken from Mt. Koya and was placed at the Kodenji. 
    <p align=justify>In the generation of Lord Mitsushige, Oishi Kosuke was at 
      first a foot soldier serving at the side of his master. Whenever Lord Mitsushige 
      was making the trip for his alternate- year residence in Edo, Kosuke would 
      make the rounds around the sleeping quarters of his master, and if he thought 
      a certain area to be insecure, he would spread a straw mat and pass through 
      the night awake by himself. In rainy weather he would simply wear a bamboo 
      hat and an oilpaper raincoat and would stand watch while being pelted by 
      the rain. It is said that to the end he never spent a single night in negligence 
      . 
    <p align=justify>When Oishi Kosuke was an uchitonin, a mysterious person sneaked 
      into the area of the maids' chambers late at night.' There was a great commotion 
      from upstairs to down and men and women of all ranks were running about; 
      only Kosuke was not to be seen. While the senior ladies-in- waiting were 
      searching about, Kosuke yanked his sword from its scabbard and waited quietly 
      in the room next to the master's bedchamber. As all was in confusion, he 
      had felt apprehension for the master and was there to protect him. Because 
      of this it was said that his viewpoint was quite different.<br>
      The man who had sneaked in was Narutomi Kichibei. He and his accomplice 
      Hamada Ichizaemon were condemned to death for adultery. 
    <p align=justify>Once when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Nishime, for some 
      reason he got very angry. He drew his sword from his obi, scabbard and all, 
      and began beating Soejima Zennojo with it, but his hand slipped and his 
      sword fell into a ravine. Zennojo, in order to stay with the sword, fumbled 
      down into the ravine and picked it up. This done, he stuck the sword in 
      his lapel, crawled up the precipice, and just as he was, offered the sword 
      to his master. In terms of quick- mindedness and reserve this was matchless 
      resource. 
    <p align=justify>Once when Master Sane Ukyo was crossing over the Takao River, 
      the bridge was being repaired and there was one large piling that could 
      not be pulled up. Master Ukyo dismounted, grasped the piling firmly, pave 
      a shout, and began to pull it up. There was a tremendous sound, and although 
      he was able to pull it up to his own height, it would go no further and 
      thereupon sank. After he returned home he became sick and suddenly died.<br>
      At the time of the funeral at the temple in Jobaru, when the funeral procession 
      crossed the Takao Bridge, the corpse leapt from the casket and fell into 
      the river. A sixteen-year- old acolyte from the Shufukuji immediately jumped 
      into the river and took hold of the dead body. Everyone then ran down into 
      the river and pulled up the corpse. The head monk was very impressed and 
      instructed the other acolytes to be guided by this young man. It is said 
      that he later became a very famous monk. 
    <p align=justify>Yamamoto Kichizaemon was ordered by his father Jin'-emon 
      to cut down a dog at the age of five, and at the age of fifteen he was made 
      to execute a criminal. Everyone, by the time they were fourteen or fifteen, 
      was ordered to do a beheading without fail. When Lord Katsushige was young, 
      he was ordered by Lord Naoshige to practice killing with a sword. It is 
      said that at that time he was made to cut down more than ten men successively.<br>
      A long time ago this practice was followed, especially in the upper classes, 
      but today even the children of the lower classes perform no executions, 
      and this is extreme negligence. To say that one can do without this sort 
      of thing, or that there is no merit in killing a condemned man, or that 
      it is a crime, or that it is defiling, is to make excuses. In short, can 
      it not be thought that because a person's martial valor is weak, his attitude 
      is only that of trimming his nails and being attractive?<br>
      If one investigates into the spirit of a man who finds these things disagreeable, 
      one sees that this person gives himself over to cleverness and excuse making 
      not to kill because he feels unnerved. But Naoshige made it his orders exactly 
      because this is something that must be done.<br>
      Last year I went to the Kase Execution Grounds to try my hand at beheading, 
      and I found it to be an extremely good feeling. To think that it is unnerving 
      is a symptom of cowardice. 
    <p align=justify>Among the pageboys in forelocks in Lord Mitsushige's retinue, 
      one Tomoda Shozaemon was in attendance. A rather wanton fellow, he fell 
      in love with a leading actor of the theater by the name of Tamon Shozaemon 
      and changed both his name and his crest to that of the actor. Completely 
      abandoning himself to this affair, he spent everything he had and lost all 
      his clothing and furnishings. And at length, when he had exhausted all his 
      means, he stole Mawatari Rokubei's sword and had a spearman take it to a 
      pawnshop.<br>
      The spearman, however, spoke up about this matter, and in the investigation 
      both he and Shozaemon were condemned to death. The investigator was Yamamoto 
      Gorozaemon. When he read the report, he spoke in a loud voice and said, 
      "The man who accuses the defendant is Spearman so-and- so .''<br>
      Mitsushige responded quickly, "Put him to death."<br>
      When it came time to announce his fate to Shozaemon, Gorozaemon came in 
      and said, "There is now nothing left to be done for you. Prepare yourself 
      for your place of death .''<br>
      Shozaemon settled himself and said, "Very well. I understand what you have 
      said and am grateful for your words." Due to somebody's trickery, however, 
      while a kaishaku was introduced to Shozaemon, it was arranged that a foot 
      soldier, Naozuka Rokuuemon, was to step from the side and decapitate him.<br>
      Repairing to the execution grounds, where the kaishaku stood opposite him, 
      Shozaemon saluted him with extreme calm. But just then, seeing Naozuka drawing 
      his sword, he jumped up and said, "Who are you? I'll never let you cut off 
      my head!" From that point on his peace of mind was shattered and he showed 
      terrible cowardice. Finally he was brought to the ground, stretched out, 
      and decapitated.<br>
      Gorozaemon later said secretly, ' 'If he hadn't been deceiv- ed, he would 
      have probably met his death well." 
    <p align=justify>Noda Kizaemon said about the function of kaishaku, "When 
      a man who has come to his place of death loses his wits and is crawling 
      about, it is likely seine damage will be done when it comes time to perform 
      kaishak. At such a time first wait a bit and by some means gather your strength. 
      Then if you cut by standing firm and not missing the chance, you will do 
      well." 
    <p align=justify>In the generation of Lord Katsushige there were retainers 
      who, regardless of high or low rank, were requested to work before the master 
      from the time they were young. When Shiba Kizaemon was doing such service, 
      once the master was clipping his nails and said, "Throw these away." Kizaemon 
      held them in his hand but did not stand up, and the master said, "What's 
      the matter?" Kizaemon said, "There's one missing.'' The master said, ' 'Here 
      it is,'' and banded over the one that he had hidden. 
    <p align=justify>Sawabe Heizaemon was ordered to commit seppuku on the eleventh 
      day of the eleventh month in the second year of Tenna. As this became known 
      to him on the night of the tenth, he sent a request to Yamamoto Gonnojo 
      [Tsunetomo] to be kaishaku. The following is a copy of Yamamoto's reply. 
      (Tsunetomo was twenty-four years old at this time.)<br>
      I am in accord with your resolution and accept your request for me to function 
      as kaishaku. I instinctively felt that I should decline, but as this is 
      to take place tomorrow there is no time for making excuses and I will undertake 
      the job. The fact that you have chosen me from among many people is a great 
      personal satisfaction to me. Please set your mind at ease concerning all 
      that must follow. Although it is now late at night, I will come to your 
      house to talk over the particulars.<br>
      When Heizaemon saw this reply, it is said that he remarked, "This is a matchless 
      letter."<br>
      From ages past it has been considered ill-omened by samurai to be requested 
      as kaishaku. The reason for this is that one pains no fame even if the job 
      is well done. And if by chance one should blunder, it becomes a lifetime 
      disgrace. 
    <p align=justify>Once when Tanaka Yahei was attending to affairs in Edo, one 
      of his menials was rather insolent and Yahei scolded him severely. Late 
      that night Yahei heard the noise of someone coming up the stairs. He felt 
      this to be suspicious and quietly got up. With short sword in hand he asked 
      who was there, and it turned out to be the menial whom he had scolded previously, 
      secretly holding a short sword. Yahei leapt down and with a single stroke 
      cut the man down. I heard many people later state that he had had good luck. 
    <p align=justify>A certain Master Tokuhisa was born quite different from other 
      people and looked to be a bit moronic. Once, a guest was invited and mudfish 
      salad was served. At that time everyone said, "Master Tokuhisa's mudfish 
      salad," and laughed. Later when he was in attendance and a certain person 
      made fun of him by quoting the above remark, Tokuhisa pulled out his sword 
      and cut the man down. This event was investigated and it was stated to Lord 
      Naoshige, "Seppuku is recommended because this was a matter of rashness 
      within the palace."<br>
      When Lord Naoshige heard this, he said, ' 'To be made fun of and remain 
      silent is cowardice. There is no reason to overlook this fact because one 
      is within the palace. A man who makes fun of people is himself a fool. It 
      was his own fault for being cut down." 
    <p align=justify>Once when Nakano Mokunosuke bearded a small boat on the Sumida 
      River to enjoy the coolness, a rogue got in too and committed all manner 
      of rude acts. When Mokunosuke saw that the rogue was relieving himself over 
      the side of the boat, he cut the man's head off and it fell into the river. 
      So that people would not notice this, he quickly covered the body with various 
      things. He then said to the boatman, "This matter should not become known. 
      Row up to the upper reaches of the river and bury the corpse. I shall naturally 
      pay you well."<br>
      The boatman did as he was told, but in the lagoon where the body was buried 
      Mokunosuke cut off the head of the boatman and returned directly. It is 
      said that this fact never became known publicly. At that time there was 
      also one young homosexual male prostitute riding in the boat. Mekunosuke 
      said, "That fellow was a man too. It is best to learn how to cut a man while 
      one is still young," and so the man cut the corpse once. Because of that 
      the young man said nothing later on. 
    <p align=justify>It is said that every time Oki Hyobu's group gathered and 
      after all their affairs were finished he would say, "Young men should discipline 
      themselves rigorously in intention and courage. This will be accomplished 
      if only courage is fixed in one's heart. If one's sword is broken, he will 
      strike with his hands. If his hands are cut off, he will press the enemy 
      down with his shoulders. If his shoulders are cut away, he will bite through 
      ten or fifteen enemy necks with his teeth. Courage is such a thing." 
    <p align=justify>Shida Kichinosuke said, "At first it is an oppressive thing 
      to run until one is breathless. But it is an extraordinarily good feeling 
      when one is standing around after the running. More than that, it is even 
      better to sit down. More than that, it is even better to lie down. And more 
      than that, to put down a pillow and sleep soundly is even better. A man's 
      whole life should be like this. To exert oneself to a great extent when 
      one is young and then to sleep when he is old or at the point of death is 
      the way it should be. But to first sleep and then exert oneself . . . To 
      exert oneself to the end, and to end one's whole life in toil is regrettable." 
      Shimomura Rokurouemon told this story.<br>
      A saying of Kichinosuke's that is similar to this is, "A man's life should 
      be as toilsome as possible." 
    <p align=justify>When Ueno Rihei was overseer of accounting in Edo, he had 
      a young assistant whom he treated in a very intimate way. On the first night 
      of the eighth month he went drinking with Hashimoto Taemon, an overseer 
      of foot soldiers, and got so drunk that he lost good sense. He accompanied 
      his young assistant back home, babbling on in a drunken manner, and when 
      they arrived there, Rihei said that he was going to cut the assistant down. 
      The assistant pushed away the tip of Rihei's scabbard. They grappled and 
      both fell into the gutter with the assistant on top pushing Rihei down. 
      At this time, Rihei's servant ran up and asked, "Is Master Rihei on the 
      top or on the bottom?"<br>
      When Rihei replied, ''I'm on the bottom !'' the servant stabbed the assistant 
      once. The assistant got up and, as his wound was light, ran away.<br>
      When the affair was brought under investigation, Rihei was put into confinement 
      at the Naekiyama prison and was condemned to capital punishment by beheading. 
      Before this, when he was positioned in Edo and living in a rented house 
      in the merchants' district, a servant had opposed him and he had cut him 
      down. But he had acted in a good way at that time, and people said that 
      he had acted like a man. This time, however, his actions were outrageous 
      and were certainly unnecessary.<br>
      If one thinks about this well from beginning to end, to get so drunk as 
      to draw one's sword is both cowardice and lack of resolve. Rihei's servant 
      was a man from Taku, but his name is not remembered. Though he was a member 
      of the lower classes, he was a brave man. It is said that Taemon committed 
      suicide during the investigation. 
    <p align=justify>In the twelfth section of the fifth chapter of the Ryoankyo 
      there is this story :<br>
      In the Province of wizen there was a certain man from Take who, although 
      he had contracted smallpox, was considering joining the forces attacking 
      the castle at Shimabara. His parents earnestly tried to get him to desist, 
      saying, "With such a grave illness, even if you should get there, how could 
      you be of any use?"<br>
      He replied, "It would be to my satisfaction to die on the way. After having 
      received the warm benevolence of the master, should I tell myself that I 
      will be of no use to him now?" And he left for the front. Although it was 
      winter camp and the cold was extreme, he did not pay any attention to his 
      health, and neither put on many layers of clothing nor took off his armor 
      day or night. Moreover, he did not avoid uncleanliness, and in the end recovered 
      quickly and was able to fulfill his loyalty completely. So to the contrary 
      of what you would expect, it cannot be said that one is to despise uncleanliness.<br>
      When the teacher, Suzuki Shozo, heard this, he said, "Was it not a cleansing 
      act to throw away his life for his master? For a man who will cut of his 
      life for the sake of righteousness, there is no need to call upon the god 
      of smallpox. All the gods of heaven will protect him. " 
    <p align=justify>Lord Katsushige said, "Whether a man of Hizen holds death 
      in regret or not is not a matter of concern. What I worry about is that 
      people will not take to heart the command to keep the rules of manners and 
      etiquette correctly. I am afraid that the entire clan, our relatives and 
      elders, out of too much earnestness, will feel that the command to keep 
      correct etiquette is an exaggeration. Up to now there have existed men who 
      were used to these things, and even if etiquette was slightly wrong, they 
      could remember the correct way, and the matter was settled. I have given 
      this command because people are negligent in affairs of this sort." 
    <p align=justify>During the Genroku period there was a samurai of low rank 
      from the Province of Ise by the name of Suzuki Rokubei. He was ill with 
      a severe fever, and his consciousness became dim. At that time a certain 
      male nurse was unexpectedly stricken with greed and was about to open up 
      the inkbox and steal the money that was kept in it. Just then the sick man 
      suddenly stirred, took the sword from the base of his pillow, and in a sudden 
      attack cut the man down with one blow. With that, the sick man fell back 
      and died. By this act, Rokubei seemed to be a man of principled disposition.<br>
      I heard this story in Edo, but later when I was serving in the same province 
      with a Dr. Nagatsuka, who was also from the Province of Ise, I asked him 
      about it, and indeed he knew the story and said that it was true. </p>
