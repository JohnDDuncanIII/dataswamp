    <p align=justify>Lord Naoshige once said, "There is nothing felt quite so 
      deeply as giri. There are times when someone like a cousin dies and it is 
      not a matter of shedding tears. But we may hear of someone who lived fifty 
      or a hundred years ago, of whom we know nothing and who has no family ties 
      with us whatsoever, and yet from a sense giri shed tears." 
    <p align=justify>When Lord Naoshige was passing by a place called Chiriku, 
      someone said to him, ' 'In this place there lives a man who is over ninety 
      years old. Since this man is so fortunate, why don't you stop and see him?" 
      Naoshige heard this and said, "How could anyone be more pitiful than this 
      man? How many of his children and grandchildren do you suppose he has seen 
      fall before his very eyes? Where is the good fortune in that?"<br>
      It seems that he did not stop to see the man. 
    <p align=justify>When Lord Naoshige was speaking to his grandson, Lord Motoshige, 
      he said, "No matter whether one be of high or low rank, a family line is 
      something that will decline when its trine has come. If one tries to keep 
      it from going to ruin at that time, it will have an unsightly finish. If 
      one thinks that the time has come, it is best to let it go down with good 
      grace. Doing so, he may even cause it to be maintained."<br>
      It is said that Motoshige's younger brother heard this from him. </p>
