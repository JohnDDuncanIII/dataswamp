    <p align=justify>When Lord Takanobu was at the Battle of Bungo, a messenger 
      came from the enemy camp bearing sake and food. Takanobu wanted to partake 
      of this quickly, but the men at his side stopped him, saying, "Presents 
      from the enemy are likely to be poisoned. This is not something that a general 
      should eat."<br>
      Takanobu heard them out and then said, "Even if it is poisoned, how much 
      of an effect would that have on things? Call the messenger here!" He then 
      broke open the barrel right in front of the messenger, drank three large 
      cups of sake, offered the messenger one too, gave him a reply, and sent 
      him back to his camp. 
    <p align=justify>Takagi Akifusa turned against the Ryuzoji clan, appealed 
      to Maeda Iyo no kami Iesada, and was sheltered by him. Akifusa was a warrior 
      of matchless valor and was an accomplished and agile swordsman. His retainers 
      were Ingazaemon and Fudozaemon, stalwarts in no way inferior, and they left 
      Akifusa's side neither day nor night. Thus it happened that a request was 
      sent from Lord Takanobu to Iesada to kill Akifusa. At one point, when Akifusa 
      was seated on the veranda having Ingazaemon wash his feet, Iesada came running 
      up behind him and struck off his head, Before his head fell, Akifusa drew 
      out his short sword and turned to strike, but cut off Ingazaemon's head. 
      The two heads fell into the wash basin together. Akifusa's head then rose 
      into the midst of those present. This was the sort of magic technique that 
      he consistently had. 
    <p align=justify>The priest Tannen used to say in his daily talks that : A 
      monk cannot fulfill the Buddhist Way if he does not manifest compassion 
      without and persistently store up courage within. And if a warrior does 
      not manifest courage on the outside and hold enough compassion within his 
      heart to burst his chest, he cannot become a retainer. Therefore, the monk 
      pursues courage with the warrior as his model, and the warrior pursues the 
      compassion of the monk.<br>
      I traveled about for many years and met men of wisdom but never found the 
      means to the pursuit of knowledge. Therefore, whenever I heard of a man 
      of courage in one place or another, I would go and look for him regardless 
      of the hardships on the way. I have learned clearly that these stories of 
      the Way of the Samurai have been an aid on the road to Buddhism. Now a warrior 
      with his armor will rush into the enemy camp, making that armor his strength. 
      Do you suppose that a monk with a single rosary can dash into the midst 
      of spears and long swords, armed with only meekness and compassion? If he 
      does not have great courage, he will do no dashing at all. As proof of this, 
      the priest offering the incense at a great Buddhist memorial service may 
      tremble, and this is because he has no courage.<br>
      Things like kicking a man back from the dead, or pulling all living creatures 
      out of hell, are all matters of courage. Nevertheless, monks of recent times 
      all entertain false ideas and desire to become laudably gentle ; there are 
      none who complete the Way. Furthermore, among warriors there are some cowards 
      who advance Buddhism. These are regrettable matters. It is a great mistake 
      for a young samurai to learn about Buddhism. The reason is that he will 
      see things in two ways. A person who does not set himself in just one direction 
      will be of no value at all. It is fine for retired old men to learn about 
      Buddhism as a diversion, but if a warrior makes loyalty and filial piety 
      one load, and courage and compassion another, and carries these twenty-four 
      hours a day until his shoulders wear out, he will be a samurai.<br>
      In one's morning and evening worship, and as one goes about his day, he 
      had best recite the name of his master. It is not a bit different from the 
      Buddha's names and holy words. Furthermore, one should be in harmony with 
      his family gods. These are matters of the strength of one's fate. Compassion 
      is like a mother who nurtures one's fate. Examples of the ruin of merciless 
      warriors who were brave alone are conspicuous in both past and present. 
    <p align=justify>There was a certain point in the conversation when a retainer 
      of Lord Nabeshima Naohiro said, "There are no men here upon whom the master 
      can truly rely. Although I am consistently useless, I am the only one who 
      would throw away his life for you."<br>
      It is said that Lord Naohiro got outrageously angry, saying, "Among our 
      retainers there is not a one who holds his life in regret! You are talking 
      arrogance!" and he was at the point of striking him when the man was pulled 
      away by others who were there. 
    <p align=justify>Once when Master Tanesada, the founder of the China family, 
      was coming by sea to the island of Shikoku, a strong wind began blowing 
      and the boat was damaged. The boat was saved from sinking by abalone gathering 
      together and covering over the damaged sections. From that time on none 
      of the China family nor any of its retainers ate abalone. If one of them 
      mistakenly ate one, it is said that his body was covered with boils in the 
      shape of abalone. 
    <p align=justify>At the fall of the castle at Arima, on the twenty-eighth 
      day in the vicinity of the inmost citadel, Mitsuse Gender sat down on a 
      levee between the fields. When Nakano Shintohi passed by and asked the reason 
      for this, Mitsuse replied, "I have abdominal pains and can't go a step farther. 
      I have sent the members of my group ahead, so please take command." This 
      situation was reported by the overseer, pronounced to be a case of cowardice, 
      and Mitsuse was ordered to commit seppuku.<br>
      Long ago, abdominal pains were called "cowardice grass." This is because 
      they come suddenly and render a person immobile. 
    <p align=justify>At the time of Lord Nabeshima Naohiro's death, Lord Mitsushige 
      forbade Naohiro 's retainers the practice of tsuifuku. His messenger went 
      to Naohiro's mansion and made the declaration, but those who received this 
      news could in no way agree to it. From their midst Ishimaru Uneme (later 
      called Seizaemon) spoke from the lowest seat, "It is improper for me as 
      a younger person to speak out, but I think that what Lord Katsushige has 
      said is reasonable. As a person who received the master's care when I was 
      young, I had whole- heartedly decided on tsuifuku. But hearing Lord Katsushige's 
      dictum and being convinced of his reasoning, no matter what the others may 
      do, I am giving up the idea of tsuifuku and will serve the master's successor." 
      Hearing this, the others all followed suit. 
    <p align=justify>Once Lord Masaie was playing shogi with Lord Hideyoshi and 
      there were a number of daimyo watching. When it came time to withdraw, although 
      Lord Masaie could stand, his feet were numb and he could not walk. He made 
      his withdrawal crawling away, causing everyone to laugh. Because Lord Masaie 
      was big and obese he was not ordinarily able to be on his knees. After this 
      event he thought it would not be fitting to he in attendance anymore and 
      began refusing such duties . 
    <p align=justify>Nakano Uemonnosuke Tadaaki was killed on the twelfth day 
      of the eighth month in the sixth year of Eiroku, at the time of the fight 
      between Master Goto and Master Hirai of Suko on the island of Kabashima 
      in the Kishima district. When Uemonnosuke was leaving for the front lines, 
      he emgraced his son Shikibu (later called Jin'emon) in the garden and, although 
      Shikibu was very young, said, "When you grow up, win honor in the Way of 
      the Samurai!"<br>
      Even when the children in his family were very young, Yamamoto Jin'emon 
      would draw near to them and say, "Grow up to be a great stalwart, and be 
      of good use to your master." He said, "It is good to breathe these things 
      into their ears even when they are too young to understand." 
    <p align=justify>When Ogawa Toshikiyo's legitimate son Sahei Kiyoji died as 
      a youth, there was one young retainer who galloped up to the temple and 
      committed seppuku. 
    <p align=justify>When Taku Nagato no kami Yasuyori passed away, Kola Yataemon 
      said that he had been unable to repay the master's kindness and committed 
      seppuku. </p>
