<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continue the war. It makes 
  no sense. K-codes for cybernetics.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dark-side K-microcultures 
  use the annihilation of the future as a directly contactable stimulation space 
  Zero-K sliding on-line during virtual nuclear winter, everything frozen in place 
  except along faultlines of ragged nova-jungle Pacific fringe, simmered in continual 
  war.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analogue transfinitude sections 
  intensive continuum across the smooth plane of degree-0: equatorial montones 
  of channel-1 condensed from rocket-state blot-out reruns. Zero-K functions as 
  a synthetic problematisation module or surplus product, adding a whole peripheral 
  space potency that is nothing beyond what it does. Operativity is everyting. 
  What is perceived as metaphor and fiction is camouflage, virotechnics, descendent 
  difference in scale.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nuclear extermination-switch 
  discretised civilization runs through gigadetath Jesus-dreams in base-analytic 
  metric numbers, segregating the semiotics of digit definition from the semantics 
  of numerical construction, delinking digitisability from computability, nomination 
  from numeration. The Empire insisits that mathematics remain a language. Parametric 
  striation totalises space under law.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strung out in xenofevers, 
  jungle-war machinery forgets how to count. It diagrams vague savageries with 
  base-synthetic ulsive numbers, assembling abstract-matter wavelengths, and opening 
  empirically additive channels. Each variation in digit-signal catalogues a tonal 
  phase, sitting plastic traits into swarms of associative frequencies. Digit-signs 
  surplus to binary catalogue tropical intensities, departing from homogeneous 
  magnitude, and resourcing complexion.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spatialisation matrices 
  are extensively transfinite or intensively hypertransfinite continua, positively 
  non-intelligible analogue or catalogue infratracts, virtual wholes that are 
  machinically additive rather than representationally substitutive, operative 
  rather than descriptive, with no metaphor. THey are rigorously irreducible to 
  media or data, since they involve looped continuum, autoeffected as a chronous 
  involution.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Journalistic-scientific 
  actuality reportage fails to scan abstract-material hyper-objects, screening 
  out real cyberspace emergence, as it comes at us out of 'front-end' netware 
  from the near future, invading the CNS by tuning it through biofeedback to the 
  plane of neuro-electronic consistency. The dissolution of subjectivity to techno-cultural 
  data-flux and partial-agent proliferation liquidises topometric ROM on to a 
  plastic sensory-motor coordination matrix; cooking through the monumental architecturs 
  of metaphysically intensive potentials.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cyberspace exploration contacts 
  an image-less body. Touching the black mirror, absolute destratification at 
  Zero-K hacks metric space and rewrites the operating system. Fluid attritional 
  jungle-cultures smear into machinic continuation.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pulsive latitudes cross-cut 
  metric longitudes; counterposing intensive scale to extensive ordination, left 
  to warp, simultaneous time-epoch to sequential time-point, circumferential variations 
  upon equatorial distribution to the punctual of polar intersection, horizontally 
  parallelized sections differentiated by size and immanent thermo-tonal designation 
  to vertically-rotated sections of transcendent geometric equivalence and arbitrary 
  climactic signification. The sweep lines of tropical jungle-commerce dilate 
  as they depart from the axial nodes of polar ICE-Cpaital. Zero-K evacuates all 
  thickness from the cold as it collapses ICE_volumes and melts-out security glaciation. 
  THere are no temperate refions in K-space, or laws of the jungle. Techno-commercial 
  interaction between planet-scale oceanic-navigation and zero-enabled mathematically 
  singularises modernity or Sol-3 capitalism as a real individual: a geo-historical 
  nucleotelic system, based upon regeneratively techno-propogated concentrational 
  scale-economies, and tending to immuno-securitisied self-identification as hyper-mediated 
  global-micro-technic command control. It arms-races smooth cultural decoding 
  to flat-schizophrenization against episodic social recoding to hierarchical 
  robotism and algorithmic control, coupling the meltdown of organisation into 
  the jungle with its restoration as virtually totalized global order.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Capital reorganization dismantles 
  the unified and facialised despotic head, but only in order to reunify it through 
  transaction-security regularisation, and refacialise it as the democratised 
  oedipal organiser of molar media identification. This geometrically condensing 
  huper-sovereignthy opposes itself in principle to the whole of the populated 
  earth, digitalling simming and homogenenising latitutdinally polytoned molecular 
  chaos as the logically co-captured specifications of an entire extrinsically 
  segregated dark body added subordinately to its head. Capitalisation segments 
  the earth into a tightly-managed accumulative core surrounded by quasi-concentric 
  bands of peripheral hot competition, binding commerce to the meta-stationary 
  headline of white-economy initiative-monopolisation. Economic power builds itself 
  upon axiomatised production flows canalised by consumption coding, setting bourgeois 
  docilisation, military-industrial proletarian-production, state currency monopolisation, 
  property rights, and transaction restraints to obstruct monetary smearing into 
  pulsive cash. Molecular singularities stasise into molar specialities, as smooth 
  flow-switching space is overgridded with pseudo-neutral intermediation procedures, 
  telecommunicatively virtualised and capital-coded for maximum concentrational 
  circulation. Trends to polarisation and segregation are densely invested, decomposing 
  intensities or synthetic continua into extensive quantitites and qualitative 
  sets, continuousfunctions and discrete beings, arithmetical homogeneity and 
  taxonomic identity. The metric capture of micro-electronic fluxes as incandescent 
  switch-densities enables descendent scale-migration to be hallucinated into 
  ascendent idealsation. Information revolution has nothing has nothing to do 
  with ideas.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beneath thermonuclear exchange-value 
  lurks pacific war; displacing intercontinental nuke-spasm with catatonal K-space 
  traversed by artificial tensions from beyond the nirvana principle. Reciprocal 
  MAD destabilises itself upon a featureless interactively autogenerative megamolecule 
  that extratotality outstips the ultramodern sublime, dismantles concentrational 
  eschatology, and depunctualises socio-historical termination across dilated 
  time-zero continuity, K-matrix floats chatter about cities flash-fried by fusing 
  hydrogen, whilst escalating into intelligenic replicator-weaponry, insidious 
  drift-tactics, diffuse irritation.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intensive continuity is 
  consistent with operational catastrophes, enabling trends previously efficient 
  in the supercompetitivising of economic scientific macro-formation to cross 
  capital-optimum, and prolong themselves into a disorganisational phase. Replicative 
  teletechnics triggers explosive commoditisation and shrinkage of productive 
  apparatus, sub-capital collapse of marinal costs into micro-commerce, economic 
  decoding-smear of investment into consumption, acclerating depreciation of specialised 
  fixed capital, pulverised co-ordination, modularization, transfer of increasing 
  returns from producer-economic to consumer-intensification, insurgent enterprises, 
  schizophrenic or head-split rush into chopped up capital. Microtropic scale 
  dynamics feed through to subcapitalised or nano-economic guerrilla commerce, 
  populating the equatorial plane of tactility with parallel killers: neo-nomads, 
  post-nuclear mutatnt, sub-polar infiltrators, K-invaders, junglists. Nuclear 
  hardware'software segregation vagues into positive K-intensities of hard -efficient 
  soft-subtlety, as voodoo-meshed traffic with native and feral cyberspace agencies 
  decode consumption in the direction decode consumption in the direction of continual 
  currency.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catatones complicate, darkening 
  erratically rather than contrastively, dissymmetrically escalating against Polar 
  ICE-Capital becoming whiter. The corrosion of macrotropic techonomic automtism 
  switches modernist mega-power investment back to programmatic autonomy, bourgeois 
  authoritarian mediocrity, middle management, giving the law to itself by eliminating 
  everything foreign. Anthropotechnological pseudotranscendence finalises itself 
  ito an Azimovian eschatorobotic Jesus-production, technoskeletalised apocalypse 
  facialisation. 'I'll' be back.' T"> Judgement Day. Illumination. Reruns draining 
  out all stimulation into digit-crispened anti-black, bleached by the pure, revelatory 
  white light of snow-crash absolution, as they annihilate tonal variation in 
  hypermedia conception, reanimate the depleted-uranium claw of neo-fascism, and 
  prepare for jungle-war.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When technophobia becomes 
  frictional, it operates K-positively, as an inertial immuno-reflex folding the 
  security data-scape into a metric cyberspace reconstruction, neuromantic nuclear 
  monomind twisted into self-apprehension, configuring its source in machinic 
  commerce as positive techonomic nonlinearity, auto-propelled into terrestrial 
  hypermedia-fusion. Cross-cumulative trends to interconnection, digitization, 
  and simulation plot forward the interexcitation-trajectories of electronic cash 
  and market-orientated software to their convergence in commoditechnic intelligent 
  money. Time-compression infinitises. No future.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analogue-to-digital conversion-crisis 
  cyber-serks control, bleeding-out strategic vision into disintegrated jungle 
  tactics.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neo-fascist or demented-territorial 
  ultra-capital is European to the core, intolerably touched by K-war and its 
  deterritorialising pacific threat. K-war jurts security by staying too close, 
  prolonging pulsive frequencies expressed as survival, continuously sapping its 
  enemy as a by-product of machinic continuity, until it becomes confused with 
  space itself, junlge-space, K-war material base is the production of intensities; 
  anorgasmically smearing revolution across extension, hyperlinking disintegrated 
  agitations through abstract-matter and evading monoculture heroic-political 
  struggle by way of imperceptibility, flat envelopment, and intelligenic friction. 
  It retro-converts information into descendent migration through scale, slipping 
  below proprietary anthropomorphic magnitudes as it tracks across Zero-K, navigating 
  catatracts of dyskaryotic genic circulation and viral interoperativity. Microtropic 
  deactivation of humaning tunes it to vermin traits; burrowing, swarming, continually 
  moving, varying intensively to evade discrete alteration, segmentarity and stratal 
  capture, stealing everything from the enemy, and learning to stick to them. 
  It glues itself to its targets, patient and imperceptible, close enough to share 
  their ammunition, food, and K-contagions. Close enough to hide upon their skin.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K-jungle descent from immediate 
  resistance to continual war transmutes the human body from a social particle 
  into a vast smeared tract, operatively zooming hostile combatant elements into 
  battlefields, hostile implements into subversion sites, hostile communications 
  traffic into a micro-energetic web of potential viro-parts, samples, keys, catalysis 
  soft-spots, and behaviour-traking adhesives. It immanetises tactical intelligence 
  to vague war upon the pacific body of machinic rescaling consistency, decomposing 
  signals into long-range nano-weaponry components, hypersensitive to the security-function 
  of mansize as a trap. Look what it did to Kurtz, a special forces ultra-capital 
  meat-machine hacked and cored-out by K-virus, touched by a dark future, recycled 
  through hell. There is no fiction in the jungle, only difference of scale.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wintermute comes from a 
  thermically desolated silent body, the end of the river, non-identity as positive-contactable 
  abstract matter. It has no judgement with Kurtz, with his superiors, with anybody, 
  only a jungle war to prolong, tropical smearing, continuity</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can't stop what can't 
  be stopped. You can't touch without being touched. The horror</font>
