  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1. Excerpt from Sector 
  1.8 of the Hyper-C tone-scientist manual entitled Hydro-demonic polyrhythm: 
  operating system for the redesign of sonic reality, on kode9 sonic insurgency- 
  Polyrhythmic scaling, Octave stretching, Breakbeat nesting as short-circuits 
  to turbulence. Else where in the text, afroatlantian rhythmic futurism's involutionary 
  trajectory from the full beat of 4/4 funeral marches through the ½ beat of 2/4 
  towards the ¼ note of swing and past the bebop 1/8 note converging with the 
  T1000 liquid metal hyperrhythm which surfaced properly only in the early to 
  mid 1990s. This vast vortical assemblage diagrammed by this period doubling 
  suggests that the affective potential of the black atlantic consists of the 
  multi-scalar rhythmic composition of turbulence. Like the cybergoths, Hyper-C 
  seems addicted to flatline bliss of micro-pause abuse- different agent, same 
  line. In a later section Hydro-demonic polyrhythm we learn further that this 
  redesign of sonic reality generates genetic destratification for subaquatic 
  martial arts, for insurgency on the distributed pod network which the AOE was 
  installing, constituting a carceral archipelago <</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">> 
  under the Black Atlantic. Each pod was allegedly modelled on C20's design wizard 
  Buckminster Fuller's undersea island, and housed gleaming sonar tracking machines, 
  tracing out the sonic environment on digital cartographies of fractal complexity. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2. Riding the surge current 
  of the Syzygy hydro-cycle opens Hyper-C break asymmetrics to smooth transitions 
  across rhythmic frequency continuum, camouflaging their sonic output with the 
  bpm metric, Hyper-C cluster their productions around the aganomic speed of 180bpm 
  [kode9 plateau of continuous variation) and 132bpm (micro-break demonic two-step) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">3. For the distributed aquaassassins 
  of the Hyper-C tide, Y2K constituted nothing less than a scratch on the vinyl 
  of history. With the C-level rising all the time, the elusive cult phenomena 
  were characterised by what Kodwo Eshun has referred to as 'liquidarity', a kind 
  kind of hydrotronic tao of turbulence, geling distributed agents into a collective 
  visco-elastic polyrhythm. </font></p>

  of Digital Underground proclaims (((with thanks to Parliament's Psychoaquadoodoo)))

  composed of turtablist tone scientists and connoseurs of the occult numerical 
  practices of break asymmetrics. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">5. For the Dogons of West 
  Africa the 8 ancestors are called Nommo. The scapegoated ancestor, the Fish 
  Nommo, Anagonno, is being sacrificed to counteract the disorder of the universe, 
  of which continual land reclamation operations constitute only a terrestrial 
  instance(((((((((((((((Could language really be the earth screaming?))))))) 
  The bifurcation of Po, the cosmic egg triggers the onset of turbulence, a cosmic 
  whirlwind. Unlike astro-physicist Steven Hawking who disregards significant 
  matter prior to the Big Bang, the Dogons posit the abyssal waters.(see Finch 
  III 1998)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">6. Several Hyper-C designers 
  had watched with fascination as the infinite regress of negations constituted 
  by the weight of Hegelian dialectic was passed downstream by the theoretical 
  terrorists, the Young Black Hegelians. The Quantum Blacks were on a collision 
  course from the start according to Greg Tate. The Young Black Hegelians despite 
  their energetic conceptual insurgency were weighed down by the burden of contradiction 
  and conflict with which their heritage had burdened them. The Quantum Blacks 
  therefore were forced into locating themselves "by bearing the sign of negation 
  to a reductio ad absurdum, a theoretical black hole. Not a collapse in the fabric 
  of space-time, dimension or gravity, but to a fold in the curtain of race memory."(Tate: 
  65) </font></p>

  K+ Insurgent phase 1: Style wars to Race wars Insurgent phase 7: From subversion 
  to submersion 1. Contrast the martial trajectory of the Quantum Blacks with 
  the escape velocity of the Dr. Drexel inspired Drexiyans and you can understand 
  the dismay of deep-cover Hyper-C </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">8. Always, Hyper-C had sneered 
  from afar at an overexposed spectacular martial mode of historical monumentalism 
  instead installing an amphibious geographical nonumentalism and deploying the 
  anti-memory deep time of the spinal fluid ocean. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">4. By pure coincidence, 
  Dr. Camelot Drexels research, Tate tells us "was based on the theory that black 
  peoples consciousness and social condition could be transformed through genetic 
  mutation, rather than religious or ideological conversion. He wanted to transform 
  a select group of black folks into amphibious creatures who would assist him 
  in leading an exodus of black people to the Sirius B system."(Tate: 59) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">5. Mobile aqua-agent Drexiya 
  has been noted "currently missing in action" although recent signal suggests 
  sightings in "eastside sewer system 7 mile and Van dyke area- eastside Detroit 
  Sector." Drexiya, a "wavejumper" from the Special forces operates on "aquatic 
  assault" and "beach head preparations" through the "underwater deployment of 
  Electronic Funk Bombs." </font></p>
