  12. The Attack by Fire<p><div align="justify">
1. Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy. 
<p>2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness. 
<p>3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration. 
<p>4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind. 
<p>5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: 
<p>6. (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without. 
<p>7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack. 
<p>8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are. 
<p>9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment. 
<p>10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward. 
<p>11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls. 
<p>12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days. 
<p>13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength. 
<p>14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings. 
<p>15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation. 
<p>16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources. 
<p>17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical. 
<p>18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique. 
<p>19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. 
<p>20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. 
<p>21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. 
<p>22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact. </div>
