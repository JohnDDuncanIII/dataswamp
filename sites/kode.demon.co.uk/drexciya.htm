<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Liquid 
  Dystopia </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drexciya drains 
  the claps, cowbells and tomtoms, siphons off the salsa from Electro. With the 
  vocoder id deleted, 90s Electro becomes even more enthralling, even more inhibiting. 
  Such tracks as '93's Danger Bay and Positron Island are monsters from the low 
  end which submerge you in liquid dystopia. Acrid frequencies clench the nerves 
  like tazers, oscillations wince across the body in wave motion, abrasive tones 
  remove cotton wool from your ears and vigorously scour inside the brainpan. 
  Jagged snare velocities pinch the nerves until you're locked uptight. Sea Snake's 
  scorching deathray sweeps the seacraters with its acoustic searchlight of astringent 
  303. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each Drexicya EP 
  -- from '92's Deep Sea Dweller, through Bubble Metropolis, Molecular Enhancement, 
  Aquatic Invasion, The Unknown Aquazone, The Journey Home and Return of Drexciya 
  to '97's Uncharted -- militarizes Parliament's 70s and Hendrix's 60s Atlantean 
  aquatopias. Their underwater paradise is hydroterritorialized into a geopolitical 
  subcontinent mapped through cartographic track titles: Positron Island, Danger 
  Bay, The Red Hills of Lardossa, The Basalt Zone 4.977Z, The Invisible City, 
  Dead Man's Reef, Vampire Island, Neon Falls, Bubble Metropolis. The Bermuda 
  Triangle becomes a basstation from which wavejumper commandos and the 'dreaded 
  Drexciya stingray and barracuda battalions' launch their Aquatic Invasion against 
  the AudioVisual Programmers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Marine Mutation 
  across the Black Atlantic</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every Drexciya 
  EP navigates the depths of the Black Atlantic, the submerged worlds populated 
  by Drexciyans, Lardossans, Darthouven Fish Men and Mutant Gillmen. In the sleevenotes 
  to The Quest, their '97 concept double CD, the Drexciyans are revealed to be 
  a marine species descended from 'pregnant America-bound African slaves' thrown 
  overboard 'by the thousands during labour for being sick and disruptive cargo. 
  Could it be possible for humans to breathe underwater? A foetus in its mother's 
  womb is certainly alive in an aquatic environment. Is it possible that they 
  could have given birth at sea to babies that never needed air? Recent experiments 
  have shown mice able to breathe liquid oxygen, a premature human infant saved 
  from certain death by breathing liquid oxygen through its underdeveloped lungs. 
  These facts combined with reported sightings of Gillmen and Swamp Monsters in 
  the coastal swamps of the Southeastern United States make the slave trade theory 
  startingly feasible.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Drexciyans are 
  'water breathing, aquatically mutated descendants,' webbed mutants of the Black 
  Atlantic, amphibians adapted for the ocean's abyssal plains, a phylum disconnected 
  from the aliens who adapted to land. As Mark Sinker argued in '92, 'The ships 
  landed long ago: they already laid waste whole societies, abducted and genetically 
  altered whole swathes of citizenry. Africa and America -- and so by extension 
  Europe and Asia -- are already in the various ways Alien Nation.' Drexciya use 
  electronics to replay the alien abduction of slavery with a fictional outcome: 
  'Did they migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River Basin and 
  to the Great Lakes of Michigan? Do they walk among us? Are they more advanced 
  than us?' </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sinker's breakthrough 
  is to bring alien abduction back to earth, to transfer the trauma from out there 
  to yesternow. The border between social reality and science fiction, social 
  fiction and science reality is an optical illusion, as Donna Haraway has pointed 
  out. They have been here all along and they are you. You are the alien you are 
  looking for. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fictionalizing 
  Frequencies</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Drexciya fictionalize 
  frequencies into sound pictures of unreal environments -- what Kraftwerk termed 
  tone films -- not filled with cars, bikes or trains but rather UAOs, soundcrafts. 
  In '93's Bubble Metropolis, Lardossan Cruiser 8-203 X prepares to dock. The 
  tones of a hydrothermal turbine engine shift gears. They fictionalize the psychoacoustic 
  volume of a giant submersible: 'This is Drexciyan Cruise Control Bubble 1 to 
  Lardossan Cruiser 8 dash 203 X. Please decrease your speed to 1 point 788 point 
  4 kilobahn. Unknown turbine engine slows down. Thank you. Lardossan Cruiser 
  8 dash 203 X please use extra caution as you pass the aqua contruction site 
  on the side of a aquabahn. I repeat: Proceed with Caution. Lardossan Cruiser 
  8 dash 203 X you are now cleared for docking. Have a nice stay here on Drexciya. 
  I'm Drexciyan Cruiser Control X 205. If you have any problems let me know. Bubble 
  Control Out.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In a War without 
  Weapons</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Black Atlantean 
  depths are as lethal as the Red Planet or The Rings of Saturn. With the Molecular 
  Enhancement EP, the ocean floor becomes the 5th front in The Forever War. Drexciyan 
  technology solidifies the ocean into hydrocubes. These blocs of solid water 
  are part of the electrofictional arsenal of Antivapor Waves, Aquatic Bata Particles 
  and Intensified Magnetrons. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The magnetron is 
  the heart of the radiowave transmitter, used to power airborne microwave radar 
  sets during WW2. As Arthur C. Clarke explains, 'When the first experimental 
  magnetron was carried to America, the face of war changed over a weekend. Japanese 
  scientists had made and tested an identical device a year before the British. 
  If they had followed up their invention we would now be living in a very different 
  world.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technology generates 
  the process Sun Ra terms an AlterDestiny, a bifurcation in time. The magnetron 
  migrates across the mediascape, changing scale from Marvel Comics 60s supervillain 
  Magneto, leader of the Evil Mutants, to Drexciya's Intensified Magnetron, to 
  Killah Priest's 'magnetron which puts your arteries back apart'. </font></p>
