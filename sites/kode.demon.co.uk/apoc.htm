            time to put aside the moral panics about synthetic drugs and cyberspace

            the Net – are not passing crazes, but "sophisticated contemporary 
            belief systems", more akin to popular religion than youth culture. 
            "The Cybergoths are a Cargo-Cult," claims Miskatonic’s Dr Linda Trent. 
            "They integrate technology into their belief system, and transform 
            the past into the future. Or vice versa."</b></font></p>

            religious objects, the Cybergoths use the relics of the information 
            age as the sacred objects of a new mythic system. But Trent, who calls 
            herself an expert in "Fictional Systems", dislikes the term "mythology.""It 
            begs too many questions, and suggests archaism. What the Cybergoth 
            phenomenon shows, really powerfully, is the difficulty in pinpointing

            some ways, when you see the remarkable pattern-matching between the 
            Cybergoth system and older belief systems, it’s tempting to see it 
            is a case of revivalism, but that doesn’t seem ultimately persuasive. 
            What needs to be accounted for is the convergences across Time: are 
            they a coincidence? Which poses the further question: what is a coincidence? 
            And that’s what the Cybergoths are all about." Trent says that the 
            Cybergoths are "natives" of Cyberspace, and the emergence of their 
            culture provides a unique opportunity for studying the process of 
            the formation of a belief system as it happens. </b></font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Trent 
            uses the term "hyperstition" for "cybernetic" belief systems such 
            as these. "It’s not a simple matter of true or false with hyperstitious 
            systems. Belief here doesn’t have a simply passive quality. The situation 
            is closer to the modern phenomenon of hype than to religious belief 
            as we’d ordinarily think about it. Hype actually makes things happen, 
            and uses belief as a positive power. Just because it’s not ‘real’ 
            now, doesn’t mean it won’t be real at some point in the future. And 
            once it’s real, in a sense, it’s always been." One key area of Cybergoth 
            activity is their response to the so-called "Millennium Bug" (the 
            computer glitch caused by the coding convention that renders years 
            as two, rather than four, digits) . </b></font></p>

            already has a calendar", a calendar counting up from 00 = 1900 to 
            99 = 1999. To avert the reversion back to 2000=00 (=1900!), the K-Goths 
            advocate not a "return" to the Gregorian calendar, but the "continuation" 
            of an "existing K-calendar", a continuation which will be achieved

            of celebrating the Year 2000, then, the Cybergoths will be "chilling

            with another ultra-secret web movement called "Hyper-C" whose "chronopolitics" 
            are, if anything, even more weird than those of the K-goths. Little 
            is known about Hyper-C, but its sporadically-issued Internet communiques 
            celebrate the very "return" that the K-calendar is designed to avoid. 
            Hyper-C seem to believe that computers have a message for us: there 
            is only one century, that counts from 0 to 99, forever. "Hyper-C are 
            another Cargo-Cult," says Trent. "But the time system they operate 
            with is very different to that of the Cybergoths. As far as I can 
            glean, their basic drift is that computers should not be tampered 
            with; that the Millennium Time-Bomb will explode western chronology. 
            There are many elements in common with so-called ‘primitive’ time;

            he describes is abduction. "The idea of alien abduction," he explains, 
            "means that we’ve all been living in an alien-nation since the 18th 
            century. The mutation of the African male and female slaves in the 
            18th century into what became negro, and into the entire series of

          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
            Abduction, of course, has been a major preoccupation in the recent 
            coverage of the Cybergoths, with outraged families complaining of 
            their children being swallowed into a world of artificial drugs and 
            schizophrenia. What abduction is really about, according to Trent, 
            is "missing time." "What’s happening out there?" she asks. "In a sense, 
            you have to have been abducted to find out." For Trent, the struggle 
            between Hyper-C and the Cybergoths is part of an ongoing "time war" 
            ("a war that’s only going to get worse, and which will affect all 
            of us"). The Cybergoths have what Dr Trent calls an "extremely sophisticated" 
            philosophy of time. "They use two interrelated diagrams or graphizations: 
            the ‘Barker’ spiral and the ‘Stillwell’ Numogram (which includes the 
            Pentazygon)."</b></font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
            "The Barker spiral maps a simple set of numeric relations, but these 
            relations have enormously complex implications," insists Dr Polly 
            Wolfe, a colleague of Trent’s on Miskatonic’s Time-Lapse sub-committee. 
            On one side of the spiral, Wolfe explains, all the numbers add up 
            to 10 ( 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, 5+5); on the other, "occulted" side, 10 
            is subtracted, and all the numbers are "twinned" to make up 9 (0 +9, 
            1+8, 2+7, 3+6, 4+5). Important here is the operation of "digital reduction", 
            in which any number can be reduced to a figure between 1 and 9, by 
            adding up its component numerals: for instance, 16 = 1+6 = 7, 17 = 
            1+7 = 8, etc. One of the many odd effects Wolfe describes is the interchangable 
            role of 9 and 0. "In digital reduction, 9 always functions as 0. Try 
            it out. Take, let’s say, 92: it = 9 + 2 = 11 = 1 + 1 = 2. The same 
            applies for any number including 9. In a sense, you can just ignore 
            the 9 – but only because 9, like 0, is everywhere." "The Numogram 
            could, in some ways, be seen as an elaboration of the Spiral," Wolfe 
            goes on. </b></font></p>
          <p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
            numogram describes relations that emerge by combining the operations 
            of digital reduction with those of "triangular numbering". In triangular 
            numbering, you add up the sum of all the numbers in the numner-line 
            up to and including the number you are dealing with; for example, 
            3 becomes 6: 3 = 1+2+3= 6. 9=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= 45 (which, interestingly, 
            digitally reduces to [4+5 =] 9). Wolfe styles herself an "Aftermathematician" 
            or "Mechanomist." "I’m a dabbler," she said . "I like to see how numbers 
            behave; I’m not interested in reducing them to instantiations of some 
            pre-existing logical system." By contrast, Wolfe insists, insitutionalized 
            mathematics can be defined by its "hostility to numbers." Dr Wolfe 
            takes seriously the so-called "numerological" traditions orthodox 
            mathematics has defined itself against, noting the correspondences 
            between the radical proto-"aftermathematical" theories she is interested 
            in – Cantor’s transfinite numbers, Godel’s diagonal numbering – and 
            older, "vernacular numeric systems". "If you look at the work ethnomathematicians 
            like [Ohio State University’s] Ron Eglash are doing, you see examples 
            of exactly the kinds of strange looped coincidences and odd doublings 
            Linda is interested in. </b></font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>In 
            one piece, Eglash describes the parallels between Senagelese sand 
            divination systems and the Cantor set. No-one is seriously suggesting 
            that there is a line of influence or evolution here; there are parallel 
            routes to the same discovery. Numbers and what they do are no more 
            something we invent than they’re already sitting in some Platonic 
            heaven." Hence mechanomics. "Mech because numeric dabbling is not 
            representational, but practical. Following what numbers do is an act 
            of production, but only because all production is really a matter 
            of discovery not ex nihilo creation. Making things up is always a 
            matter of subtracting from zero." </b></font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Of 
            key importance here is the role of "infinitesimals", which, according 
            to Wolfe, are a major theme in "Gothic numerics". The term Gothic 
            is "not idle. Differential calculus was once dismissed as a ‘Gothic 
            hypothesis’, since it posits quantities irreducible to standard unitary 
            quantification. In a way, zero – so controversial when introduced 
            into Europe – is itself a Gothic quantity. And what the cybergoths 
            call ‘Uttunul’ is crucially connected with Cantorian continuum." "Uttunul" 
            is one of the five "entities" that populate the Cybergoth system. 
            ("It’s wrong, strictly speaking, to describe the system as belonging 
            to the Cybergoths," Trent interjects. "They use it, but its origins 
            are very mysterious." ) The five entities each correspond to a "Barker-twinning" 
            or "Syzygy", the pairings which make up 9 (1/8, 2/7, 3/6, 5/4, 9/0) 
            and which together constitute the "Pentazygon" ("Five-twin"). The 
            first three of these beings make up "the cycle of time", whilst the 
            other two are – in some sense – "outside" sequential time. The cycle 
            the system describes, Trent points out, is "multi-levelled"; it is 
            also, for instance, also a story about the journey from land to sea 
            and back again. Katak.(5/4) is "associated with the desert, with heat 
            haze and shimmer. In many ways, its key features – claw marks, teeth 
            – seem to recall werewolf legends. Its time is a time of cataclysm; 
            its appearance always presages disaster. Sometimes imaged as an hydrophobic 
            or rabid dog, Katak can partly be characterised by a horror of what 
            will supercede it in the cycle, Mur Mur (1/8), the Dreaming demon 
            of submersion. </b></font></p>
          <p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mur 
            Mur, meanwhile, carries echoes of the legends of Sea Beasts and ancient 
            serpents; its time is the Deep Time of the ocean bed. Like Katak, 
            it too, is horrified by what will follow it in the cycle; in this 
            case, Oddubb (2/7), the amphibious entity, associated with the crossing 
            out of water and the acquisition of lungs. What Mur Mur fears is the 
            division that Oddubb brings, the splitting of the undivided waters. 
            Oddubb is defined by ambiguous and elusive movement. As its name suggests, 
            it is a ‘double-agency’, a duplicitous creature. It has a horror of 
            dryness, of the state of being fully landlocked that comes with Katak. 
            Which brings us full circle." The two entities that are "outside time" 
            - Djynxx (3/6) - "a changeling figure, defined by a jinking (eratic 
            or zig-zagging) movement, a sudden cutting in or out" – and Uttunul 
            (9/0), the "flatline" entity, connoting "continuum, zero-intensity, 
            void – eternity not as infinitely extended time, but as No-Time" – 
            are in many ways the most fascinating and disturbing of the set, associated 
            as they are, for Trent, with old mythologies of "child abduction" 
            and Hell. But is all this merely an attempt to populate a disenchanted 
            world with old gods? Or is cyberspace – and the world – really crawling 
            with these creatures? "Perhaps it’s all make-believe," Trent smiles 
            enigmatically. "But don’t underestimate the power of belief to make 
            things happen…"</b></font></p>
