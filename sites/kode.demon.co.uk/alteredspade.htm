  he became interested in a genetic development program at Howard University spearheaded 
  by Dr. Camelot Drexel. Dr. Drexel’s research was based on the theory that black 
  people’s consciousness and social condition could be transformed through genetic 
  mutation, rather than religious or ideological conversion. He wanted to transform 
  through genetic mutation, rather than religious or ideological conversion. He 
  wanted to transform a select group of black folks into amphibious creatures 
  who would assist him in leading an exodus of black people to the Sirious B system"

  June 19, Drexel and an armed band of followers hijack a Japanese space station 
  project and leave earth, presumably headed for Sirius B. On June 23rd, rumors 
  circulate that the ship was destroyed by a US space-based laser satellite at 
  the request of the Japanese governmenet. In protest, major insurrections break 
  out in Brazil, USE and the USA. Now based in Los Angeles, Mandela Ain’t Free 
  forms a theoretical terrorist sect known as the Young Black Hegelians, later 
  the Quantum Black Movement. Drexel’s brother, Rahman Ibn Hassan, signs contract 
  with Warner Galactica to write Black Star Fucker, a biographical account of 
  Drexel’s mystery-shrouded childhood years." </font></p>
