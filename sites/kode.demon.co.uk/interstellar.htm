<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Over the 
  ages there have been outbreaks of resistance to what the human spirit knows 
  is evil, but is forced to accept as normal. This resistance due to recent advances 
  in genetic research has been traced to an elusive mutant gene that is found 
  in one of every five thousand humans. We will refer to this gene and R1. R1 
  is older than humanity itself and was sequenced into human genetics by probabilities 
  still unknown. R1 communicates through secret coded rhythm patterns based around 
  the drum which is common in all human societies. It should be noted that these 
  rhythms can also be vocalized, expressed through dance or art and transfered 
  via rhythmically oriented machinery. In this manner R1 can download huge portions 
  of data to those who remain close to the drum with no chance of file corruption, 
  missing or damaged pages and certainly no misinterpretations. As these rhythms 
  are pure R1 consciousness only true expressions will create movement of the 
  physical and spiritual realms. Imitations or derivatives will only have a chance 
  to move the physical as the spirit will not recognize them. R1 throughout the 
  centuries has been suspected to have been at the heart of countless rebellions, 
  coups, overthrows and revolutions. As long as trigger conditions exist R1 will 
  hold the world in a constant state of potential. R1 can modulate itself to emulate 
  other genes in order to hide among the hosts gene pool until triggered. Triggering 
  occurs due to many different input. Injustice, prejudice, oppression, rape, 
  torture and genocide or all fuel for the fire. Once triggered the R1 will emerge 
  and become the dominant factor among the 80,000 or so other genes that it will 
  rearrange and interact with over a period of years to make the host achieve 
  R1 purpose. The R1's biological instructions are capable of converting the most 
  humble human into a digital ebola guerrilla operative (D.E.G.O) with reinforced 
  rhythm awareness capabilities. Sometimes the careful eye can spot an active 
  R1 in its early stages of development as the human host's morality and prior 
  teachings delays the R1 shadow warrior techniques. The host is visually and 
  vocally active as it causes suspicion, unrest, inspiration, hope and mental 
  or physical resistance among the once docile population. unfortunately the host's 
  lingering faith in humankind leads to it's ultimate demise as it is identified 
  and targeted for destruction. These young R1's usually cause immense problems 
  for the system. Techniques have been developed over the ages to dilute their 
  effectiveness trough controlled distortions, history and advanced pacification 
  programs. it is for these reasons many diabolical minefields have been devised 
  to take out young R1s before they can reach maturity. if allowed to reach maturity 
  the R1 can redefine the host and operated indiscriminately until death within 
  the system currently being employed. in a constant search for ways to combat 
  the ever increasing evil of the systems programmers, R1 has most recently employed 
  a little known frightening bioengineered mutant cousin gene that was created 
  during a period of time ranging from 1400's to the late 1800's in colonized 
  areas throughout the world and especially in the new world of the Americas. 
  the cousin which we shall call Z (for zero) to signify its complete erasure 
  from history was the result of illicit genetic breeding experiments performed 
  on enslaved human stock with the R1 gene. against the generally accepted practice 
  of killing the defiant R1s on site in order to assure a compliant myriad of 
  docile worker stock. Some owners paid top dollar to buy R1 stock in order to 
  breed R1 with various other R1s and with the new highly resistant U1 native 
  stock which were bravely fighting to the death in the Americas. much the same 
  as current dog breeders do today with familiar breeds like the K9 German shepard, 
  rottweiler, doberman-pincer and the pitbull terier. genetic engineering of this 
  type was done in hope of creating a warrior enhanced humanoid to be utilized 
  specifically for prize-fighting entertainment, or as expendable soldiers for 
  future nations to be colonized. Female R1s and many enslaved women were often 
  forcibly raped by their captors (see Brown Sugar by The Rolling Stones). This 
  introduced and unseen sadistic viciousness into an already aggressively resistant 
  gene pool. Always the opportunist R1 would scan the intruder's genetics to investigate 
  and extract strengths, weakness, tactics and potentials for future use. the 
  result of all these accumulated sins may never be fully understood. these complex 
  genetic combinations administrated by people who had no idea of the genetic 
  Pandora's Box they were about to open yielded Z gene stock which was super-athletic, 
  deviously intelligent, swift, silent, deadly, adaptable, efficient, durable, 
  strategic and at the moment of need chillingly cold. unfortunately along with 
  these desired soldier-like features there came unforeseen side-effects. for 
  the first time humans could be mass produced and created without love. The Z 
  models were capable of spontaneous, strategic, symbolic or unprovoked violence 
  against its oppressors or co-operative stock of its own kind with no remorse 
  (see Nat Turner). apparently it was controlled by R1 which had overridden the 
  breeder's control parameters set forth for the Z. the Z model was chameleon 
  like, unpredictable and final (see the Maroons) and although it could deceptively 
  function within any given society it would only take true direction from R1. 
  Using its enhanced rhythm perception it could decipher R1 directives from anything 
  ranging from a fieldwork song to the rhythmic flow of a poet's lines to automated 
  modern machinery. The X model was considered economically costly and impossible 
  to contain and after many bloody revolts, uprisings and overthrows this type 
  of breeding was discontinued. The Z model especially in the United States was 
  systematically targeted for destruction (usually by inaccurate lynching). It 
  was hoped that the dreaded Z had become extinct by the early 1900's. But based 
  on the specific type, intensity and history of resistant hostilities in the 
  United States's large cities it is conceivable that large numbers of R1 and 
  Z genes made it North and elsewhere hiding amongst the huge gene pools of workers 
  who would leave the South during the early 1900's. The Northern industrial city 
  Detroit was especially well-suited for R1. This mechanically pulsed city provide 
  R1 with a perfect rhythm foundation to transmit its subversive instruction sequences 
  to those who know in the city's population. Living in the shadow of the unending 
  broken promises of the system R1 found this city a perfect breeding ground for 
  resistance. many examples of R1 instructed people emerged from the bowels of 
  this mid-West metropolis. Against all odds these people set standards of resistance 
  which have inspired millions. One particularly disturbing result of R1 is a 
  virus-like consciousness called Underground Resistance. Since 1988 to present 
  this outfit has been responsible for infecting huge parts of the world with 
  R1's teachings via a Black vinyl data disc army sonically spawned somewhere 
  in Detroit. Under orders from R1 U R as many before then have with the technology 
  available to them at their particular time-frames has discovered an unknown 
  way to assemble R1's thoughts into tones, these tones which are then rhytmically 
  generated by discarded instruments or electronic devises and sonically injected 
  into humans that were previously incapable of understanding R1. This is a most 
  dangerous situation as traditionally only other R1, Z or societies close to 
  the drum could decode these messages! It should be noted that once injected 
  the newly infected host's hard drive will be erased and rebooted with R1 algorhythms. 
  The only known way for the system to combat R1 is to counter inject false prophets 
  of sound into the populace. These puppet agents will be controlled and formatted 
  by the programmers with sole purpose of leading the naive and unknowing away 
  from R1's teachings. This has worked many times before, and the only reason 
  it will not work this time is because of U R, its global allies and invisible 
  infrastructure of support. The eight fugitives pictured are suspected U R operatives. 
  Trained in Detroit by U R they are all highly skilled at their particular method 
  of sound injecting R1 purpose into the cutting edge of human society's world-wide 
  as they now have global strike capacity via programmer digital communication 
  systems. The leader of the fugitives is feared to be in latter stages of Z gene 
  development. This stage is called negative evolution. In this state human characteristics 
  begin to fade. The voice becomes unrecognizable. Efficiency and logic become 
  the host's new religion and chance of capturing or learning the fugitive become 
  next to impossible as the fugitive becomes a fibreoptic commando which can alternate 
  between the physical world and a digital consciousness. As aspirations for continued 
  colonization and exploitation extend into outer space, scanning technology must 
  be developed to intercept these disruptive genes before mass space travel and 
  sex in zero gravity. In addition the U R tone generators and their operators 
  must be silenced now before even more of their infectious sound waves escape 
  earth's atmosphere. Now that R1 has been traced from nation to nation it is 
  feared that U R's intention is to go from world to world, galaxy to galaxy and 
  eventually universe to universe. In closing it is this galactic bureau of investigations 
  (G.B.I) conclusion that U R, the interstellar fugitives and the Black Vinyl 
  Data Disc Army at will must be destroyed by you to protect us. In the words 
  of one of the greatest R1s ever &quot;By any means necessary&quot;.</font></p>
