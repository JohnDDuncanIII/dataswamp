  system of forces that causes or tends to cause rotation, a twisting effort applied 
  to a object, body or limb that tends to make the object turn about its axis 
  of rotation. The magnitude of a torque is equal to the magnitude of the applied 
  force multiplied by the distance between the object's axis of rotation and the 
  point where the force is applied. In many ways, torque is the rotational analogue 
  to force. Just as a force applied to an object tends to change the linear rate 
  of motion of the object, a torque applied to an object tends to change the object's 
  rate of rotational motion.</font>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Unequal exchange- the 
  immanence of axiomatics escalates perturbation from ripples to tidal waves of 
  decoding and deterritorialization with the flick of the switch- capitalism implodes 
  as perfected revolutionary overdrive.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Zero sum war games deployed 
  on the socio-scape "Crime 'war', drug 'war,' 'battle' for the family. . .wherever 
  there is a perceived danger, there is deterrence; whenever there is deterrence, 
  there are immanent boundaries; and wherever there are immanent boundaries, there 
  is organised violence. For having boundaries that are actualised by being crossed 
  is a very precarious way to run a world"</font>

  1992 prime time. judicial rubber stamping of video captured micro-fascism ignites 
  urban turbulence. The anti-black counter-insurgency of "the dream city of free 
  circulation" programmed to irrigate afro-futurist hydraulics. discard population 
  or resort to modulation; integrate or exterminate.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Ultra-real video capture 
  dissolves nostalgia. LA Law edits Kings beatings to generate bizarre retrospective 
  lubrications for control machinery. Digital cut ups of the video, freeze framing, 
  stretching and looping the baton swings in order to saturate Kings black body 
  in signs of danger, fight and flight.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. That episode is saturated 
  with the solid state code of homey hunt counter hydraulics. the fear of untamed 
  speed. Rhizomaniac pattern recogniton confuses King’s vector through Lake View 
  Terrace with the nomadic gangbangers of South Central, the focus of LAPD's deployment 
  of low intensity warfare on the multi-ethnic field. The paranoia of population 
  lamination processed the temporary truce between Crips and Bloods as stage 1 
  of a Farrakhan orchestrated take over conspiracy demanding the management of 
  "terrorist" populations, through actual or virtual imprisonment and martial 
  law localised to the 'hood.</font>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. "The social and political 
  fluidity of late capitalism has not been accomplished by a withering away of 
  state violence. On the contrary, state violence has also been fluidified and 
  intensified. The rapid deployment force is the model of late capitalist state 
  violence, on all fronts: the ability to descend 'out of nowhere,' anywhere, 
  at a moment's notice- the virtualization of state violence, its becoming immanent 
  to every coordinate of the social field, as unbounded space of fear."</font>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Riot coverage shot from 
  helicopters doubles as news footage indicating a shift from the ubiquitous vision 
  of the sovereign to the stereoscopic partial coverage of monitor. Zoooooom lense 
  technology advances since Watts '65 engaging a regurgitative potential. The 
  eye converges with the arm. Visibility is death. Lasered futures. Latitudinal 
  Zero. Absolute speed.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Lamination is the capture 
  of decoded flows using LAPD rhizomaniac vortices sent through South Central 
  searching and sucking up all amateur video footage of the riots. the fear of 
  an unmeasurable speed. Naked LAPD, slooshing down media meme pool flumes entangled 
  with the Kings' other body, Rodney King. In South Central, the memes go swimming 
  in a flashpoint to urban turbulence. </font>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. "the wind of violence, 
  unleashed, mastered, lost, retaken, delirious, and disciplined. It subsides

  . .from bodies to the collective, in a lightning short-circuit, without language, 
  through the groundswell of violence and pandemonium."</font>

  the LAPD chemical clock, frozen with their pants down revealing erect baby lobsters. 
  LAPD, zone of indistinction rapidly oscillating between thin blue line, the 
  threshold of capital security and bloody red stains on their paranoid armoury. 
  Naked LAPD, apparatus of capture, cybernetic homeostatic hoover with teeth, 
  emptying its migrant dust into the deep end of an increasingly pervasive carceral
