<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increasing 
  ubiquity of sound-recording technologies (essentially diagramming or stratigraphical 
  systems) has, in transforming sound into stored material, deritualized and demystified 
  the experience of music. Increasingly appreciated as much for abstract sonic 
  qualities as for ostensible musical ‘content’, able to employ a vast range of 
  sonic resources, ‘performed’ unceremoniously every day and everywhere, music 
  is drawing nearer to an immanence with general ambient sound. At the same time, 
  we are growing accustomed to the experience of absolutely synthetic sound, sound 
  only made possible by the recording technologies themselves. Analysis of the 
  production of machinic surplus value in such processes and the exact fate of 
  such excess machinic production provides a key cross-section of the abstract 
  machine of capitalist production and its future. On this route through the phylum 
  of the sonic assemblage, abstract matter becomes not only a comprehensible and 
  applicable term but an uncompromisingly tactile phenomenon. Beginning with Capitalism 
  and Schizophrenia’s insistence that the diagram is never simply a tracing, or 
  a representation, the key process of capitalist machinic abstraction and its 
  enslavement to the docilizing powers of consumer capitalism can be approached 
  through the sonic assemblage: the interaction between human body and the fundamental 
  molecular disturbance which constitutes sound, and the machines which interpose 
  and mediate within it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hearing already 
  presupposes a complex of syntheses, biological and mnemotechnical apparatus 
  of capture. The function of memory in the feedback loops of the simplest humanoid-sonic 
  assemblage introduces the possiblity of continually sophisticating circuits 
  of reception and transmission, the exploitation of coded sound, Rhythmic disturbances 
  become interpreted as traits of external phenomena in recognition patterns where 
  meaning can already by analysed into signaletic frequency response:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All that can be 
  inferred from a signal may appropriately be called the ‘meaning’ of this signal. 
  Depending on the complexity of an organism’s nervous system, the meaning of 
  a signal can vary from a simple initiation of a feeding response, that it, the 
  signal means ‘food’, to a realization of the most complicated relationships 
  in an environmental situation."(Foerster and Beauchamp 1969: 7)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This may primarily 
  be made possible by the production of a reliable method of recording, for a 
  stable storage system is necessary for such a process to take place. That there 
  are biological, even inert, recording technologies is established by Capitalism 
  and Schizophrenia’s ‘Geology of Morals’. Systems of Stratification, deducting 
  similar elements from a material flow and arranging them in resonantly ordered 
  compounds, produce stabilized, resistant matter. Therefore corporeal reality 
  as such is constituted as a gigantic memory, densely embedded synthetic compounds 
  differing in degrees of plasticity and modes of composition. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although contemporary 
  recording processes allow us consciously to treat sound as a synthetic assemblage, 
  there have been few attempts to discuss music in terms of its machinic processing. 
  Music would perhaps like to remain the stratified and secretive reserve of soulful 
  artists. Pragmatically, however, the field of sonic production has provided 
  an unparalleled fertility for strato-analytical procedures to emerge and develop. 
  Given the preponderence of interpretative ‘readings’ of all manner of subjects, 
  it is refreshing instead to be able to listen to strato-analysis in action. 
  Writing more often that not provides a system a recording whose ‘object of study’, 
  exploiting it parasitically, nonetheless surpasses it in terms of machinic connectivity 
  (this piece being no exception) this piece being no exception). The written 
  word proves redundant, disintensified and insufficiently plastic. An effective 
  strato-analysis requires a system of recording which fulfils the required criteria 
  immanently without pretending to a relationship of absolute objectivity, the 
  theatre of representation, thus becoming the writing of the State. A writing 
  is required which operates on vectors directly consistent with other matter. 
  By listening to the strato-analysis achieved in the sonic assemblage, steps 
  can be taken towards such a writing machine. The musical division of sound into 
  pitch and duration (the stave) deducts audible vibrations, and fold the audible 
  continuum at a threshold point (physically about nineteen cycles per second, 
  although the threshold is rarely explored), to form two exclusive time-series 
  which articulate sound as complicit relations of content and form. Pitch assigns 
  a signifying value (note) to cyclical transformations of molecular compression 
  and rarefaction, and duration gives the metric length of the tone, which positions 
  it in relation to other tones, or ‘empty’ spaces. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even phonography 
  freezes intensive difference into extensive surface inscription, disjoining 
  intensity and duration. The recording made by phonographic apparatus depicts 
  sound as a waveform etched onto a moving surface, with time and amplitude (amount 
  of molecular displacement) plotted perpendicularly. For any given sound, pitch 
  rises as duration is shortened, and duration is lengthened as pitch is lowered 
  (thinking of changing the speed of a record player). Sounds become packaged 
  objects for the clockspace of a mechanical duration, two measures in reciprocal 
  presupposition, biunivocal time-series: one naming (pitch, amplitude), the other 
  counting (time signature, recording speed). Compressive/extensive (content/expression) 
  Double pincers locking into compensatory homeostasis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vibrations are 
  perceived through rapidly oscillating differences in pressure, the measure of 
  amplitude, and consequently the sensation of acoustic intensity, being relative 
  to a molecular equilibrium. The vibratory continuum plus into the delta and 
  theta waves of the brain, into bodily sensation and ultimately into temperature, 
  at hyper and sub- sonic values. Pitch slides into duration as it decreases, 
  as harmony becomes monometric rhythm (the properties of consonance and dissonance 
  result from the factorial resonance of combined frequencies [1]). And sound, 
  on its broad peripheries, creeps out of the brain and into the body, then out 
  of conscious sensation altogether. Since mechanical recording apparatuses know 
  no such distinctions, human territorializations of the vibratory continuum on 
  all levels- psycho-physiological, cultural and musicological- can only be relativized 
  by the acute analysis of sound. Stratal schema are transcendentally deduced 
  from experience. They map real memory systems, but these are only guaranteed 
  sovereignty for as long as they are venerated as the final cause of the intensity 
  which is articulated through them: fetishism (Pythagoras: ‘Everything is number 
  and harmony’".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The distinction 
  between content and expression is always real, in various ways, but it cannot 
  be said that the terms preexist their double articulation."(Deleuze & Guattari 
  1987: 44)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reinforcement 
  of material and conceptual stratifications of sound makes Western music a wasteland 
  of redundancy. Sonic technology locking into the song as tragic-orgasmic structure, 
  emotional engineering overlaid by the signifying power of words; the cultural 
  fixing of molar arrangements of specific instruments (orchestra to rock band) 
  with a certain predictable range of musical effects. Harmony and counterpoint 
  limiting the sonic to a grid of resonant points. Harmonc and monometric form 
  itself as Hellenic beauty, right through to the transcendental despotism of 
  Kant’s Stimmung, is endemic in Western art. In the Western tonal musical form, 
  the tension of dissonance is always relieved by a consonant homecoming; this 
  is implied even in the facetious mischief of the avant garde. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Formed by these 
  resonant coding systems, the reproduction of Western music has long been a specialized 
  technique, it performance linked to ritualized spectator events and expressions 
  of power and its graphism being the preserve of specialized cognoscenti. Mechanical 
  recording makes these techniques entirely procedural, and the mode of production 
  and reproduction of sound becomes an increasingly dispersed network. At the 
  same time as it immanentizes music, speech and other ‘noise’, mechanical sound-recording 
  potentially flattens the divide between musician and listener, allowing the 
  latter a (perhaps modificatory) hand in the performance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The digital manipulation 
  of sound accelerates to the point of breakdown the loop between playing and 
  recording, composing and listening and even between composer and sound. Summarized 
  and abstracted in the circuits of digital sound manipulation are the obvious 
  virtues and the incidental features of the entire history of sound-recording 
  technologies. This latest stage of the abstractive vector of the sonic assemblage 
  stand in relation to late 1990s capitalism as the phonograph stood to the industrial 
  age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The phonographic 
  diagram, given its direct transduction of physical wave to mechanical or electrical 
  signal, provides a code both precisely reproducible and potentially editable. 
  There is no need of specialised knowledge to interpret the phonographic record: 
  where the score represents, phonography simply transduces and can evidently 
  not be described as a system of writing, but only as a diagram, despite its 
  investors’ wishes:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"(T)hey intended 
  it as surface for the preservation of representation, in other words, a protector 
  of the preceeding mode of organization. It in fact emerged as a technology imposing 
  a new social system, completing the deritualization of music and heralding a 
  new network, a new economy and a new politics - in music as in other social 
  relations."(Attali 1985: 89)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sound remains stratified 
  only to the extent that systems of observations and recording are the preserve 
  of the powerful or wise, and their codes and territories appear as the divine 
  presupposition of acoustic phenomena. But if the locking-in and conceptual reinforcement 
  of such coding systems are inevitable, then also a very different process necessarily 
  follows form the increasingly radical analysis and resynthesis of sonic material. 
  The production of a sonic technology implies the construction of principles 
  on the back of a deterritorialization (the production of an interruption or 
  break in the assemblage at a certain point and the arbitrary repetition or redeparture 
  from that point, transforming the conditions of possibility for sound production) 
  and a decoding (rendering any regime of sound-ordering relative within a field 
  of chromatically variable parameters) whose efficacy potentially releases, or 
  releases the potential of, the matter of sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"[T]rends in the 
  evolution of Western Music begin with Pythagoras and terminate - open-ended 
  - with the theories and experiments of (electronic music). . . . What are these 
  trends? They are most clearly understood in information-theoretical terms, namely 
  as a gradual reduction in the redundancy in works of music or, expressed differently, 
  as a continuous increase in the complexity of sound and composition, hence an 
  increase in the amount of auditory information transmitted during a given interval 
  of time. Redundancy reduction has been achieved over the last two millennia 
  by a steady abolishment of constraints on three levels: specificity of waveforms, 
  selection of frequencies, and rules of synchronism and succession." (Foerster 
  and Beauchamp 1969: 9) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sciences are 
  incomprehensible apart from their combination with currency (communication): 
  processes are only modelled in order to abstract and reproduce them on a more 
  efficient basis, at will, or in bulk quantities. But concurrently, the street 
  finds its own uses, and always produces strange offspring. In the middle of 
  the processes of analysis and synthesis, the diagram or abstract machine of 
  the assemblage at issue is seized upon by uninvited forces. Instead of simply 
  reproducing, the diagram slowly yields its machinic surplus value.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As soon as the 
  deterritorialization of sonic matter into vinyl abstracts it from the moment, 
  and makes music into this random-access memory available time and time again, 
  the sonic matter is susceptible to temporal mutation, warping, looping. The 
  simple laws of selection and connection of elements within any medium used to 
  store an abstracted signal produce a machinic surplus value anexactly proportional 
  to the differential between its immanent logic and that of the `original' medium, 
  or its derangement of temporal normativity (deterritorialization). The contact 
  between vinyl and hand, the technique of 'scratching', is an interface between 
  temporal systems: rendering the abstract tactile (abstract matter is not a figurative 
  or Likewise metaphorical term), this unplanned interaction makes audible more 
  about the technology than even its designers were able or willing to realize. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The memory-system 
  of a phonographic record could easily be (and was intended these to as) a simple 
  archive, exerting a minimal derangement easily counterbalanced by the entities, 
  State-friendly effects of pseudo-propaganda (Edison envisaged us listening to 
  stirring engineering records of political speeches rather than music). Only 
  in materially realizing the unassuming temporal derangement - the abstraction 
  - which had taken place, by creating something new out of the record, was the 
  machinic potential of the apparatus unlocked. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Despite the contemporary 
  omnipresence of such abstract matter, a huge amount of energy is spent in preventing 
  this from happening - docilizing consumers into using it simply as archival 
  material, or as negative-feedback entertainment. However technology decodes 
  human experience, redundant forms are tenaciously reaffirmed. Even in the age 
  of digital technology, the production of a gigantic surplus value is suppressed 
  or absorbed by the fetishistic packaging of ever-reproduced classical and `classic' 
  Western forms and the recording industry's strangely hypocritical (if not surprising) 
  promises of authenticity and faithfulness. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While decoding 
  doubtless means understanding and translating a code, it also means destroying 
  the code as such, assigning it an archaic, folkloric or residual potential, 
  function." (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 245)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bourgeois tragic 
  pop culture revels in a retro-reactive fascination for these archaisms, building 
  them back into the system at the level of ironic simulation, as `classics' - 
  further strengthening the reflection-reproduction of a self-satisfied human 
  interiority under the great weight of its own poignant degeneration. Nomads 
  are more interested in migrating, investigating where else technological synthesis 
  then can take them, via the abstract, the diagram, the plane of consistency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A synthesizer 
  places all of the parameters in continuous variation, gradually making `fundamentally 
  heterogeneous elements end up turning into each other in some way'. The moment 
  this conjunction occurs there is a common matter. It is only at this point that 
  one reaches the abstract machine, or the diagram of the assemblage."(Deleuze 
  and Guattari 1987: 109) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise the sampler 
  places disparate sonic elements upon a plane of consistency without destroying 
  their particular traits, the intensities produced in the sonic assemblage by 
  their singular complex of rhythmic disturbances. Instead it enables these to 
  be systematically diagrammed, edited, merged, manipulated as virtual entities, 
  then reactualized. Sound becomes a series of partial objects for engineering, 
  rather than an object of admiration for heavenly metaphorics. Even unassuming 
  theorists who provide reconnaissance data for nomadic war upon the strata know 
  to some extent what they're doing:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I would hope that 
  we could soon find whatever . . . excuse we still need to quit talking about 
  `mellow timbres' and `edgy timbres', and `timbres' altogether, in favor of contextual 
  musical analysis of developing structures of vibrato, tremolo, spectral transformation, 
  and all those various dimensions of sound which need no longer languish as inmates 
  of some metaphor."(Foerster and Beauchamp 1969: 128)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The plane of consistency 
  is the abolition of all metaphor - all that consists is real." (Deleuze and 
  Guattari 1987: 69) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is truly the 
  minority whose experimentation has begun to explore the full potential, the 
  true alien nature of abstract matter. The question will be, what sort of tactics 
  are most efficacious in the releasing of machinic potential (surplus-value) 
  And how is it that, speaking in terms of the sonic assemblage, the vernacular 
  cybernetics of underground subcultures have already sent such vectors crashing 
  through the strata?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Lift the needle,

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A machine may 
  be defined as a system of interruptions or breaks. These breaks should in no 
  way be considered as a separation from reality."(Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 
  36)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Breakbeats - cannibalized 
  rhythmic segments of soul and funk records, looped and mixed endlessly, becoming 
  dehumanized chunks of sound migrating from their function as a `break' within 
  the song. DJs invaded by turntable logic, forming non- organic circuits to produce 
  another time. MCs overlaying breakbeats and misappropriated soundbites with 
  street neologisms, comic-book mechanismo and afro-blag, and returning them to 
  vinyl. </font></p>

  voodoo-tech somatics of the grey area between the white lines of neo-classical 
  German synth-pop and the legacy of the black heroes of funk and soul.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hip-hop, together 
  with many other sources, recycled once (many times) more in dance tracks where, 
  de/reterritorialized as digital signal, sound is redesigned and reprocessed 
  and once again returned to vinyl for DJs to mix into complex layers and sequences, 
  melding tracks together. At every stage of this sonic metallurgy, a complex 
  feedback and slippage between the functions of crowd, musician and ' machine, 
  where sounds produce and execute their own evolutive pressures. New strains 
  emerge faster than you can count.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As LA's gangsta 
  rap played uncomfortably upon black American youths' status as , `niggaz' and 
  revitalized the memory of soul and fiu~lc pioneers, jungle, &om the inner cities 
  of the UK, recalls racist taunts, immigration policies, inner-city meltdowns, 
  and the hybridities of dub, rave, jazz, ska and twotone. It synthesizes distorted 
  patois gun talk, horror video samples, dubterranean sub-bass and accelerated 
  razor-sharp rhythms digitally cut into precise flurries. 1'he rhythmic eccentricity, 
  anexact precision, and constant development of jazz lines shot through with 
  the mechanical pounding of funk and house and the cavernous low-end of dub. 
  Africa filtered through Diaspora, alienation, urban decay and techno-virtuality, 
  the supposedly `impossible combination of blackness and the future' (Fisher 
  1995) lethally injecting the colonial terror of the living jungle and its `natives' 
  with SF future-shock. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sound is no longer 
  experienced as whole, recognizable and familiar structures, associated with 
  persons or instruments; it doesn't signify. Sounds could have come from anywhere, 
  and can potentially go anywhere, mutating as they pass through multiple vinylurgical 
  singularities (tracks). They engender their own vast, clandestine plane which 
  is nothing apart from what moves on it but is nonetheless real, transversal, 
  tilting though heaps of bastardized techno-junk, Cubasing across bedroom studios 
  . . . swerving through clubland, into advertising . . , sinking back into James 
  Brown and P-funk and Dub and Voodoo . . . diving through magnetic signal, vinyl, 
  vibration, intensity . . . transmitting as cultural virus, pirate radio, illegal 
  duplication . . . opening onto insomniac planes, fashion codes, violence and 
  ecstasy, social disintegrations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Composition by 
  experimentation: the keys of the synthesizer keyboard have only a machinic relation 
  to the sounds they trigger. Unlike the state-numerical system of the musical 
  scale, the digital sequencer operates nomadically: number systems with no necessary 
  hierarchical relations but available to be assigned for maximum functionality, 
  references and designations reassignable and manipulable on every level, numbers 
  working rather than signifying. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Samplers making 
  time for the future: timestretching, a digital technique commonly used in jungle 
  which elongates sounds without altering their pitch, demonstrates how the speed 
  at which levels of acoustic intensity are digitally recorded (around 44,000 
  samples/second) means that a certain level of destratification is automatically 
  accomplished. Since magnitudes (of acoustic intensity) are all that each sample 
  bit contains, they can be manipulated so as to operate underneath the stratification 
  of pitch/duration which depends on the differentiation of the relatively slow 
  comprehensive temporality of cycles per second. Designed to tune up samples 
  of musical instruments, timestretching is employed as a means of creating periods 
  of disorientating duration, impossible speeds and slownesses, realizing the 
  temporal disturbance it is capable of. This is only to repeat again that acute 
  analysis of strata presupposes sub-stratic sampling and so is tantamount to 
  their dissolution, and the freeing of machinic potential. This principle also 
  applies to sampling in the more usual sense, as the decontextualized use of 
  pieces of recorded sound (and to similar techniques in other media). Most of 
  the accumulated techniques of today's sonic engineers were acquired by chance, 
  or as a response to some mechanical or economic limitation. That's the story 
  of hip-hop, the cyberpunk history of a new sonic assemblage taking shape with 
  neither metanarrative nor progressive urgency. Unexpected convergences during 
  the bricolage of machine-sequenced sound count more than planned outcomes. Following 
  the grain of sound, rolling with the rhythm. Distributed wildstyle jamming, 
  describing polyrhythmic lines of metamorphosis which take in at irregular intervals 
  sample, sequencer, composer, party crowd, DJ. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The much-vaunted 
  connection between avant-garde movements such as serialism and musique concrete 
  and hip-hop techniques needs to take account of the fact that, far from being 
  an intellectual experiment, hip-hop has always been concerned with producing 
  the maximum intensity where it matters: bodily sound, made for dancing, no interpretation 
  necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This reticular 
  phylogenetic webbing of transcodings and deterriorializations marks out hip-hop 
  and its progeny as the sound of superheated anthropo-technic circuitries, where 
  decoded flows begin to leave meaning behind, and escape from molar commoditization 
  by means of a constant flight underground. Uprooted shapes and sounds merge 
  and rescript, break up and repermutate in the virtual machinery of the sampler 
  whilst social fabric warps into localized chaosmosis. A subterranean diagonal 
  which unconditionally migrates from its habitat: accelerating BPMs (no time 
  to understand), reprocessed percussion (Neither harmony or noise), timestretching 
  (violating the chronogenic homeostat of pitch/duration) and sub- bass (sound 
  becoming uncompromisingly physical) retune the neuro-auditory apparatus to awesomely 
  intricate and dense abysses of sound, and permeate the body as an amnesiac addiction.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But why was it 
  the bass and percussion breaks that set the ghettos alight, that demanded a 
  line of flight out of the song? The operation of rhythm within the African socius 
  involves physicality and communication, rather than signifying sound shut up 
  in the soul of the music-lover, merely an adjunct to the harmony of the spheres. 
  African rhythm is a body technology, a precise component, like African art which 
  is assigned its function by nommo, power of the word (Jahn 1961 : ch. 5), and 
  discarded when it has been used, rather than being retained for eternity in 
  the museum (a scandal which led the `art-world' to have serious doubts about 
  its value). It is the Western art object which is t6e fetish'; and it is logocentric 
  Western world history which cannot understand the transitive voice of the drum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voodoo loa are 
  rhythms, or traits immanent in the social machine, which manifest themselves 
  in response to needs of that machine.3 From where voodoo is the Christian God 
  is oppressively monometric and dysfunctional. When the Haitian authorities tried 
  to force the slaves to convert to Catholicism, the slaves received a new god 
  into their pantheon, wondering only why the white man lets just one (dull) loa 
  ride him. For the divine nature of the loa is in their immanence and availability, 
  not in a miraculous transcendence at once inutile and terrifying which despotically 
  inscribes its disjunctions onto the social body, allowing no feedback. Even 
  Bon Dieu is neither feared nor praised. `Vodou isn't like that. . . . It isn't 
  concerned with notions of salvation and transcendence. What it's about is getting 
  things done' (Gibson 1993: 111). Voodoo drums call Legba, loa of the pathways, 
  to remove the barrier (the black mirror) which seals the street of the loa off 
  from the human world. Intoxicating polyrhythm calls the loa to ride the initiates, 
  to possess them, to inhabit them with their trances, their traits, their dances. 
  Sound experienced as bodily sensation, rather than spiritual recreation (Jahn 
  1961: 122) shows how African languages express non-visual intensity as tactile. 
  "The bassline. Bass it all. Going back to the beginning of everything. . . . 
  The tribal notes, the lost civilization of drum and bass. Bass is the vanishing 
  point on the horizon where all black music disappears back to."(Two Fingers 
  and Kirk 1995: 100-1) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The climatic impracticability 
  of an extensively developed writing system in early African history produced 
  an asignifying semiotic which resisted the vertical flight of interpretability 
  and signifiance. The drum functioned as immanent memory system and transmitter 
  of cultural history, co-intensive with the intonation and percussion oF African 
  languages (a coupling still present now in hip-hop). The somewhat repellent 
  modus operandi of the slave trade was to capture tribes, destroy the drums, 
  and then claim disgustedly that Africa had `no history'. Not that the ROM-museum 
  of Western history could claim any filiation with the vastly distributed machinery 
  of a communicative social machine whose resilience defies genocidal colonialism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The virtual history 
  of the drum gradually rematerializes, irrupting into Western music like a long-awaited 
  revenge for its brutal silencing. Speaking for centuries in all outlawed musical 
  forms, those which explored the virtual spaces of sonic assemblages rather than 
  reciting texts, and currently in cyberflux digi-processed afro-futurist, it 
  steals sounds and speaks them back in its own becoming-Creole (nommo is always 
  a becoming-word and a word-becoming which does not signify but (re-)invents 
  what it is applied to), its own complex of rhythms. The meme- grinder. Predator, 
  indiscernible jungle warfare. All State authorities, like the Haitian plantation-owners, 
  fear the materiality of sound, and the unintelligible, ungodly rites that surround 
  it (sampled/sequenced music is the first form of music to have its performance 
  specifically proscribed by an Act of Parliament). Again and again the drums 
  are confiscated, but the Black Secret Technology continues. Voodoo, the practice 
  of rhythmic contagion, is the tactile point of contact between the social body 
  and the deterritorialized socius, proceeding by means of decoded sonic affect 
  to reinsert the social into the pulsive maelstrom of matter-flows. Dahomian 
  snake- becomings (plunging desiring-machines into the Bw0) transform into distributed 
  and refined subsocial programs under ascendant pressure from secured State molarity, 
  travelling unnoticed by icebound damping systems. The Critique of' Pure Reason's 
  `profoundly schizoid' (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 19) theory maps reality as 
  intensive magnitude, `beginning in pure intuition = 0' (Kant 1933: 202 At66/B208), 
  `continuous' and `Rowing', the `matter' of experience (Kant 1933: 204 AI7O/B211). 
  Rational categories supplant the positivity of intensity with the ultimate and 
  empty form of experience, zero intensity as negation, as the miraculous hypnostatic 
  attractor of pure intuition. A complete stasis, an escape from `that element 
  which cannot be anticipated' (Kant 1933: 204 A170/B211), which brings us closer 
  to the god of the disjunctive syllogism. 'The tautological death of pure form: 
  a favourite trope of philosophy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Capitalism and 
  Schizophrenia's zero intensity is not a zero of absence or negation but more 
  like the zero of MIDI which designates the establishment of a plane of communication. 
  The surface of a full body where intensity ebbs and shatters. Or think of the 
  way morphing drum patterns glide and trip across the surface o£ their own momentum.</font></p>
