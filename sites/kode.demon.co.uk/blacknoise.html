<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BLACKOUT- Jungle is creeping 
  necrosis eating away of melanin-deficient flesh. Genetic piracy hacking into 
  white DNA and recombining it. A 'bacterium mutated into a more lethal form. 
  . .some malignant sci-fi creation. . .out of control', a 'microbe. . .infected 
  with a virus which 'switched on' lethal genes. . .</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHITEOUT- At the same time 
  (and many 'times' run simultaneously here) Jungle is whiteout, a hyperversion 
  of whiter than white pop. Hear it as the latest product of the black fascination 
  with white futurism that began with Afrika Bambataa's hijacking of Kraftwerk. 
  'What Afrika Bambataa and hip hoppers like him saw in Kraftwerk's use of the 
  robot was an understanding of themselves as <U>already having been robots'</U> 
  Jungle's SF disstopias recall the posthuman teknoscapes imageind in the barely 
  remembered 'embarrassing' musics of Gary Numan, John Foxx, the Normal, Japan. 
  BUt this time it's beyond the 'song', beyond any human speculation; now it's 
  all a matter of interlocking circuits, 'the continual whirr of machines'. . 
  .The human persists only as ghostly traces, ambient decoration, sound effects: 
  'the residual subject off to the side, alongside the machine, around the entire 
  periphery,a parasite of machines, an accessory of vertebro-machinate desire.' 
  </font>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> D-FACED - So, of course, 
  it's facelss, (dis)located at the point 'beyond the face' where 'cutting edges 
  of deterritorialization become operative and lines of deterritorialization positive 
  and absolute, forming strange new becomings, new polyvocalities.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW ZONES of post-essential 
  blackness. Whatever top down reterritorializations are imposed, blackness is 
  a matter of deleting identities rather than defining them. 'Identity' in black 
  culture is always a matter of becoming. There is no truth but the vehrshon. 
  Anything that's not all-white immediately becomes-black. Jungle is hip hop with 
  the last vestiges of 'natural' funk removed + house shorn of all humanist glitz/gospel 
  evangelism + digitized reggae +</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BABYLON TIMEWARP- Nothing 
  here is in real time. Everything you hear is timestretched, virtualized on the 
  plane of consistency as digital informatin then actualized again as metallic 
  voodoo simulacra.. Slower or faster than the original. Accelerated trills up 
  and down the piano, abrupt switches in temp, moments of dread slowness punctuated 
  by the highest of squeals. . .' Everything plays at (at least) two speeds.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You're talking about things 
  I haven't done yet. . .'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SPLICING- The sampler is 
  just like the telepods in The Fly, taking human and nonhuman, fusing them at 
  the molecular level and moving them somewhere else.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GIBSON was already part 
  way there in Neuromancer. 'It was called dub, a sensuous mosaic cooked from 
  vast libraries of digitalized pop; it was worship. Molly said, and a sense of 
  community;' Dub was always virtually present in hip hop; funk and house but 
  it's been re-actualized in Jungle (and every 90s music that matters) as low-frequency 
  languor, half-speed bas. ('It's the ganja,' Molly said. . .) Anyway, dub is 
  not a form of music so much as a mode of parasitism, a viral contagion using 
  host bodies to replicate itself; a version is what is left when the song has 
  been hollowed out, involuted.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFROFUTURISM- Jungle is 
  unimaginable from where the White Man is. From there, 'Black' = prehistoric 
  origins, the dark hole we came from. The future=history, i.e. more of the same. 
  Jungle is the impossible combination of blackness and the future, the dark continent 
  we're heading towards.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DREADNAUTS- Cybernauts. 
  Afronauts. 'Black people live the estrangement that science fiction writers 
  imagine.'</font>
<P> 
<P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JAMAICA- Nomadology: 'The 
  maroons were the first black rebels on the islands. The word refers to runaway 
  slaves who formed their own outlaw communities in the mountainous interiors 
  of Islands liek St. Kitts and Barbados. But the Jamaican maroons were the ones 
  most feared by the British authorities.' Don't look for roots in JA, although 
  in a certain sense it all begins there. 'A rave, be it programmed Jungle, Techno 
  or HOuse, is just a big dance with a massive sound system on which DJs present 
  special mixes. In Jamaica they've been doing that for more than forty years. 
  . .'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SHATTERED WINDSCREEN- 'Hardcore 
  is to pop culture as ramrading is to Rumbelows - a storm bang concussion </font>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHITE TRASH- Yet Jungle 
  could only happen here. It's a peculiarly British assemblage; what happens when 
  'the chickens come home to roost. The British Empire has folded in on itself. 
  And as the pressure in the cities has mounted, the old national culture has 
  started cracking at the seams.' Black and white fusing on the estates, in the 
  dancehalls and on the plane of consistency.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BLACK ECONOMY= 'You can 
  locate hardcore as the black economy of British culture. Its effect extends 
  way beyond music.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CRACK UP. Breakdown. Shock 
  out. 'They don't make much of a difference between state, you know? Aerol tells 
  you what happened, well, it happened to him. It's not like bullshit, more like 
  poverty. Get it?'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALCHEMY- Reggae has always 
  been produced in conditions closer to a factory than a theatre. Hardheaded economic 
  pragmatism drives the producers as they transmute MOR chart hits into bass heavy 
  libidinal flow. Deterritorialization as alchemy. ;Zion smelled of cooked vegetables, 
  humanity and ganja.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ILLEGAL SUBS- Rave was E-state 
  music. Darkside was Crack House.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ESCAPE VELOCITY- 'An Escape 
  for language, for music, for writing. What we call pop- pop music, pop philosophy, 
  pop writing. . .TO make use of the polylinguism of one's own language, to make 
  a minor or intensive use of it, to oppose the oppressed quality of this language 
  to its oppressive quality, to find points of nonculture or underdevelopment, 
  linguistic third world zones by which language can escape, an animal enters 
  into things, an assemblage comes into play.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PRESENT TENSE- 'There is 
  only a NOW that is either blissed-out or dread-ful (dread is a kind of jouissance 
  in negative,a slow subsidence into uncontrol and panic.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MULTIPLICITY- 'Ragga' and 
  'Jungle' designate multiplicities not unities: get up close to either and they 
  fractalize into micromultiplicities rather than fragment into component parts. 
  Ragga was already a becoming reggae of hip hop, hip hop was already a becoming 
  electro of soul and funk. The becoming jungle of ragga and the becoming ragga 
  of jungle is only one zone of intensity, only one intersection, to be tracked 
  in this music. Rewind to the becoming jungle of rave, the becoming jungle of 
  hip hop, listen again to the becoming dub of jungle, then fast forward into 
  becomings and couplings not yet synthesized. The temporality isn't white culture 
  linearity (one form superseding another) but rhizomatic involution (the past 
  as template not monument) Think recycling not revival. 'There was a kind of 
  ghostly DNA at work int the Sprawl, something that carried the coded precepts 
  of various short-lived subcults and and replicated them at odd intervals.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHILDEN OF THE DAMNED- 'We 
  know that 13-17 years old adults are nothing more than demon seed, the damned 
  children of England (an estate block in drawn out and terminal decline.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Fads swept the youth of 
  the Spawl at the speed of light. Entire subcultures could rise overnight, thrive 
  for a dozen weeks then vanish utterly.'</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GREY ZONES- What happens 
  when white and black are (re)mixed. Temporary Autonomous Zones. Unpoliced, unlit, 
  unseen. Suddenly, anything can happen. . .Hello darkness.</font>
