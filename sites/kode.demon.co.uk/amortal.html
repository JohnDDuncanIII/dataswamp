<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Amortal Kombat</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Round One</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the blue corner 
  Western Bodily Organization: WBO. A male-ordering physiognomic force field that 
  shudders to maximum density in that other WBO, which is its abstract machine, 
  the World Boxing Organization.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Caught in the pull 
  and tug of the WBO’s disciplinary tractor beam the male body is dragged through 
  an ultramagnetic origami of serial foldings, bent double in street scuffles, 
  pulled upright again in sweat soaked subterranean gyms, in road running, in 
  amateur bouts until, eventually, buckled under the weights and belts of the 
  prize fights, it emerges: the WBO. Muscles have been dangerously dehydrated 
  then ripped, skin torn and stretched, bones repeatedly broken and reset, organs 
  are lifted and separated. "Bruised, battered and scarred, but hard" a molar 
  organism raises its aching right arm aloft in obedience to the Judgements of 
  God. A body built around a pulsating command centre- that Joe Louis’ called 
  ‘heart and mind’- and fortified by metallic musculature of cold-forged character 
  armour. Duel of the Iron Mike and Two-Ton Tony Galento, battling for Golden 
  Gloves. Sporting double-edged adamantium shells that both ruthlessly isolate 
  the male body in its lonely Being- seconds out: you’re going "solo like a Tyson 
  bolo"- and rigorously obliterate any stirring Becomings that could engineer 
  a shift onto the plane of intensity that is Deleuze & Guattari’s Body Without 
  Organs: the BWO.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For Becoming do 
  occasionally threaten to KO the WBO. But there can be no Boxer Rebellion and 
  any attempt to get on the plane is battered into submission. The heavyweight 
  fighter Lou Nova rearranged his motor systems through <I>chi</I> power-ups, 
  macrobiotic diets and yogic meditation in order to deliver a Cosmic Punch, but 
  he was smashed down to meet Earth’s intolerant corpoReality principle by a punishing 
  Joe Louis’ right hook. Muhammed Ali’s famous shuffle too came close to achieving 
  a drum & bass synchronicity of speed and slowness, to achieving a motion-blurred 
  transversality that would escape the sedimentary carbon plating of the WBO and 
  enter the nomadic silicon planing of the BWO. But the fluid circulation of these 
  effects was cruelly Hoover damned and the incipient flows turned back to Clay. 
  And Ali’s attempt at unnatural participation in a becoming-animal were similarly 
  blocked before they could precipitate a take-off of the plane of consistency. 
  <I>Like</I> a butterfly, <I>like</I> a bee. "There is always the danger of finding 
  yourself ‘playing the animal’" . Playing Oedipal domesticity. George Foreman: 
  the Mummy; Sonny Liston: the Bear. Playing at imitation and analogy. "Becomings-animal 
  continually run these dangers". You can rope-a-dope as much as you like but 
  the WBO will wear you down, ring you in then ring you out- for the count.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">But blocking the 
  plan(e) to the BWO is not the WBO’s only danger. Beyond the WBO’s disciplinary 
  corpoReality principle, squat a gloating <I>Todestrieb</I> or death drive, obscenely 
  beckoning with promises of neuronal scheering, vascular disruption, the neuropathology 
  of <I>dementia pugilistica</I> and death itself. Boxer Arthur Cravan might have 
  survived a shuddering first-round Jack Johnson southpaw to the jaw, and might 
  have fervently embraced Dada but the <I>Tode</I> still got him, breaking the 
  placid surface of the Caribbean Sea to upend his lonely rowing boat.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Perhaps the primary 
  zone of destruction targeted by WBO offers a clue to its secret. The WBO is 
  a front-organisation for Mind Inc. - a shady outfit run by Rene "Cherry Nose" 
  Descartes operating out of Holland. The WBO butchers its subjects into Cartesian 
  headcases for which the body is just sos much remote-controlled meat to be "bruised, 
  battered and scarred". Max Schmeling, Hitler’s "heads up" boxer was exemplary", 
  his body the WBO’s pawn trying to check the plane to he BWO.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Round Two</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Bruce Lee was also 
  a chess-player but he nearly avoided being checked. For him T’ang-te, Wado-Ryu, 
  Tae Kwon Do, Shaolin Ch’un Fa, Shri-te, Kung Fu, Ju-Jitsu, Karate even Filipino 
  Eskrima and Southern Indian Silambam and Kalaripayit were no different from 
  WBO boxing. All "solidify the fluid", all "arrest the flux" of the BWO, all 
  promote "the blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of routines that lead 
  nowhere". What was required was the "formlessness [to] assume all forms", "no 
  style [to] fit with all styles". What was required was a rhizomatic openness 
  which could turn the sedimentary closures of WBO against itself: "to be like 
  water [to] penetrate and destroy rock". </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Shimmering in shattered 
  glass, smashing the mirrored cage. Free of traitorous <I>hsing</I> of subjectification 
  and free of treacherous <I>i</I> of signification: "No form, no meaning". No 
  hsing-I, no choking WBO, only the cloaking imperceptibility of formlessness 
  and meaninglessness that announces the BWO. Bruce Lee, like Deleuze’s dancer, 
  "already a sleepwalker, who will be taken over by the movement that seems to 
  summon him."(C2: 61)</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">But Bruce Lee awoke 
  too soon and in resisting the somnambulant intensity of the BWO stumbled back 
  into the WBO and all its dangers. Perhaps it was Hegel bellowing in his ear 
  that awoke him. After hammering out philosophy master papers on <I>The Phenomenology 
  of Spirit</I> and <I>The Science of Logic</I> on his battered type-writer, Lee 
  wiped the sleep of becomings-animal from his eyes. Exit the little dragon and 
  enter instead Lee demanding his students be merely "like a leopard" that they 
  simply "emulate the beauty of a crane of the ferocity of a tiger". "There is 
  always the danger of finding yourself ‘playing an animal’". Fully alert now, 
  instead of accelerating the practice of <I>Mushin</I> or "no mind" to escape 
  velocity, he insisted that "the body always follow the mind", that Jeet Kune 
  DO was "an excellent discipline for the mind". The external, dermal discipline 
  of boxing was effortlessly replaced by the internal <I>chi</I> control of JKD. 
  "Disciplinary man produced energy in discrete amounts, while control man undulates, 
  moving among a continuous range of different orbits"(N: 180) The body is your 
  lobster.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The rows of mirrors 
  are now shattered in order to avoid multiplicity, to leave the mindful individual 
  alone with Yip Man at the chessboard, alone with the push ups and the training, 
  alone with a gallery of sepia Oedipuses- the framed fathers, the Sifus, Senseis, 
  Asan: the Masters- alone with his opponent in a game of death. The mortal kombat 
  begins. In a desperate flurry of moves wrenched from the Jeet Kune Do grab bag, 
  Lee attempts to force the WBO back and get on to the plane of the BWO. The special 
  technique of shadow-boxing, nerve-destruction grips drawn from kali, two kicks 
  tot he knees from Southern wing chun, an elbow to the groin from bak hoopai, 
  rabbit punches to the neck, tiger claws raking the face, tossing bombs from 
  tae kwon do to the kidneys. An exhausted kiai and his energy is spent. But JKD 
  now has its own form, its own meaning, its own rigidity.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The fist of fury 
  is intercepted. The mirrors are now broken <I>Pat-Kwa</I> charms. Broken and 
  unable to protect Lee from the forces of the WBO. A taste of blood from his 
  finger tips, the Big Boss WBO beckons. Electric flashes as the physiognomic 
  forcefield fluctuates then focuses its disruptive energy. Lee, like Shang-Chi, 
  the master of kung-fu, tears back the tapestry of tao to reveal death staring 
  back in the mirror of morality and mortality.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><I>Round Three</I></font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The year 2002 and 
  the battle’s still Wu. But now its amortal kombat, a mindless detrimentalism 
  engineered in the arcade and the dancehall. Intensity achieved not by localising 
  at the origin of an effort that characterises the organism (WBO) but by dissolving 
  into the middle that is the virtual. Virtua fighter materialises on the plane 
  of consistency.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Who dares challenge 
  the mighty Goro? Goro, Prince of Pain and the final guardian of the WBO. Tearing 
  at the joystick, rattling the keys, adrenalised, libidinised, immediating. Becoming-elemental 
  with Sub-Zero’s ninja icefield, with Hydro’s illogical water, with Thunder God 
  Rayden’s crackling lightning, with Wynd and Rayne. Becoming-mineral with demon 
  sorcerer Shang Tsung and kicking like Kano, the Black Dragon’s most deadly assassin. 
  Becoming-imperceptible with Reptile and becoming-invulnerable with Scorpion. 
  "Specialise in interstices" and enter the zone, the BWO.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It is not surprising 
  that the plateau of continuous immanence that is drum & bass conjugates with 
  amortal kombat in its dismantling of the organism’s strata. Big up your chest, 
  wind up your waist. Limb by limb, the WBO is mashed up; the European corpoReality 
  principle disorganised and detrimentalised. "Here comes the nice and easy tiger 
  style", "Snake Style", "The Crane". Not Ali’s shuffle but the hard-step: step, 
  step, step, step, stepper. Keep moving, never stop moving, motionless voyage, 
  designification, desubjectification, detrimentalism: grooveriding. "Breath comes 
  quicker, head nodding with the bass-line that hasn’t arrived yet. An imperceptible 
  movement. Neck driven, wind assisted" (J: 100). Body-popping, break-dancing, 
  beyond the Judgements of God and on the BWO.</font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Choose the sword 
  or choose the ball. Amortal kombat: diagonalise between the WBO’s double strata 
  bind of a vertical anti-body that butchers the meat for the mind and a horizontal 
  armouring that folds and forges the body in an origami of disintensification. 
  Amortal kombat: detrimentalist groove-riding.</font>
