      <p> Today, we are so awash in corporate propaganda that we're like the fish 
        that can't see the water that surrounds us. Of course we remember the 
        storyline of most of the television ads we see, but what brand and was 
        that cleaning fluid mark "super extra wash" or "prowash ultra"? 
      <p align="left"><img src="images/026_volym.JPG" width="167" height="227"> 
      <p> This effect, our tendency to miss the "point" of the commercial spot 
        has only one remedy - more advertising. But like TBC bacteria, we're rapidly 
        becoming immune to the standard cure. Some months ago here in Sweden, 
        one of our biggest coffee brands announced the contest "our best commmercial 
        spot" trying to draw even more attention to their popular line of corporate 
        propaganda films. 
      <p><font size="+1">"Corporations are basically lust driven enterprises" 
        </font> 
      <p> The film that immmediately came to mind as the best film was, as I soon 
        realized, made by a rival brand that had similar commercials. There are 
        so many coffee commercials now that they have started to interbreed, and 
        by making a commercial in the same style as a more established advertisement 
        series, it's possible to hi-jack much of the original's impact. At first, 
        I thought I would call the company and make enquiries about the competition. 
        However, a couple of days later I realized I had completely forgotten 
        which company it was let alone which commercials they've made. I have 
        been manically ad-surfing, channel-flipping, in a desperate search for 
        a follow-up or some piece of intel. Needless to say, I haven't found the 
        slightest trace that this competition has ever taken place. 
      <p> The between-show time, the advert time, is what makes up the marketable 
        portion of modern television. This is the time that brings up the revenues 
        that makes a cable company turn a profit. Here memes meet to breed and 
        roam the mindscape of millions of hapless viewers. 
      <p> Even "norms" do adhacking these days; the latest gimmick du jour here 
        in Sweden is a line of CD's entitled "Dom bästa reklamlåtarna" meaning 
        "the best commercial songs". The movie "Demolition Man" ran on state television 
        the other night, in this movie people listen to commercial jingles as 
        _real_ music - a clearly intended gag in the film. Now reality is catching 
        up - we're moving towards the flatscreen future presented in the film 
        and we're starting to take interesting measures to hack the commercial 
        onslaught TV presents us with. 
      <p> The music on the already mentioned CD has been made famous by its use 
        in commercials. The music definitely sells better after having been used 
        in an ad. Also the feeling of the song is enhanced by its use in a spot, 
        an intense moment of cleverly constructed reality intended to boost sales 
        for a product. But now, were swimming in such a mass of advertisment that 
        we are having trouble remembering which commercial belongs to which brand. 
      <p> When advertisment and the feeling - brand connection is quickly eroding 
        out, what is left? The act of buying (and drinking) coffee has been transported 
        into a lush hyperreality where we act and feel like on commercials. The 
        same goes for the hyperreal songs of commercials, we forget the brand 
        name and go for the pleasant feeling that the dumb corporations so kindly 
        have provided us with, and we don't even have to buy their product! 
      <p align="left"><img src="images/026_hogtalare.gif" width="226" height="184"> 
      <p> <font size="+1">"Cries of 'Seize the Simulacra!' echo through satellite 
        uplinks and reverberate in the cable TV rhizomes." </font> 
      <p> Even if corporations are the big scare, the big crook in this world, 
        we still have to use them if we don't go completely luddite. Yes, there's 
        alternative distribution systems and so on but, some of the products we 
        absolutely gotta have, ask any woman if she'd like to use old rags or 
        hi-tech sterilized wing-equipped sanitary towel. Being upset about the 
        state of the world leads just to irritation, why not _enjoy_ the crookedness 
        and absurdity of late 20th century. Face it - it aint' too bad to live 
        in a demented surrealist world.
