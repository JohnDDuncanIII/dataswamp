              <p>The times they are a-changing, and so are religious cults. Gone 
                are the poker-faced, black-clad doomsday sects - they simply didn&#146;t 
                hold up in the ever-changing, dynamic religious marketplace. The 
                new hot religions have had to adopt a set of new features to attract 
                new customer-worshippers. Powerbase Alpha wants to give you a 
                head start by introducing some of the bleeding-edge pseudo-religious 
                movements and determining which of them is the most streetwise. 
              </p>
              <p>We should start by dismissing some of the alternatives summarily. 
                Scientology does have some claims to hipness, since it was invented 
                by a kooky SF writer and investigated by luminaries like Bill 
                Burroughs; it also boasts a lot of gear - eccentric machines designed 
                for fine-tuning the human brain. On the other hand, we feel that 
                it has been around too long, and hey - who wants to be associated 
                with a movement that has been embraced by Tom Cruise and John 
                Travolta? Aum Shinryoko, which on the surface has all the right 
                stuff - psychedelic drugs, genetic engineering, and high-tech 
                equipment - is not a serious alternative; even being the hard-nose, 
                insensitive semi-robots with little or no concern for human values 
                that we Powerbasians are, we feel that it was a Bad Thing to try 
                to kill of Tokyo&#146;s population with sarin. After all, who 
                would make our Pok&eacute;mons, our Hello Kitty sex toys and robot 
                pets if Japan was wiped out? </p>
              <p>No, the only real candidates today are Falun Gong and the Ra&euml;l 
                movement. Surfing the web sites of these movements brings hours 
                of endless joy. Let&#146;s take a brief look at each of these. 
              </p>
              <p>Falun Gong </p>
              <p>Falun Gong, also called Falun Dafa, became instantly well-known 
                all over the world in 1999, when it was banned by the Chinese 
                government. Founded by the flamboyant Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong is 
                a mish-mash of traditional Chinese belief systems, spiced up with 
                a few New Age-style modifications (although the followrs emphatically 
                deny the New Age connection). &#145;Falun&#146; means &#145;the 
                wheel of the law (or dharma)&#146;, and this wheel is supposed 
                to be located in the lower abdomen. One of the more gullible followers 
                in southern China actually died after trying to extract the wheel 
                of the law by cutting up his stomach. Do not try this at home. 
              </p>
              <p>Falun Gong has gained support largely because it is disliked 
                and even vehemently opposed by the government (although many of 
                the officials in the higher echelons are said to be hard-core 
                devotees). In China, Falun Gong invites comparisons with anti-authoritarian 
                religious movements that have traditionally risen to oppose the 
                ruling dynasty. Examples include the Taiping rebellion in the 
                mid-19th century, a pseudo-Christian movement whose devotees thought 
                themselves to be invisible, and whose uprising threw the country 
                into turmoil, and the White Lotus rebellion against the Qing dynasty, 
                led by a &#145;master of martial arts and medicine&#146;, Wang 
                Lun, in 1770. </p>
              <p>Although Falun Gong may be politically correct, at least to Western 
                eyes, its teachings are kooky indeed. There is a system of &#145;levels&#146; 
                that practitioners may attain if they perform the exercises advocated 
                by Master Li, like &#145;Penetrating the Two Cosmic Extremes&#146;, 
                &#145;Falun Heavenly Circulation&#146; and &#145;Strengthening 
                Supernormal Powers&#146;. Reaching level 4, for instance, the 
                Falun buff&#146;s vision and hearing will become supremely enhanced, 
                and latter levels bring skills like levitation and the opening 
                of the Third Eye. The benefits are immense; just witness this 
                testimony from a 12-year-old devotee in Toronto: &quot;I used 
                to like to boss around the other kids at school, but I don&#146;t 
                want to do that any more.&quot; </p>
              <p>A category where Falun Gong loses out in the hipness department 
                is the anal-retentive insistence upon the superiority of Falun 
                Gong over all other belief systems. Master Li&#146;s words must 
                be heeded at all times, and you cannot practice Taiji or Qigong 
                on the side, because this will &#145;pollute your wheel&#146;. 
                On the plus side, the movement uses the internet extensively, 
                and Master Li is holed up in an unknown New York apartment with 
                his family, remote-controlling his devotees presumably through 
                divinely gleaned Perl scripts and the like. Of course, no self-respecting 
                contemporary pseudo-religion could do without aliens, so Li has 
                thrown some of them into the mix, although it is unclear (to say 
                the least) from the writings what they have to do with anything. 
              </p>
              <p>Lots of people have tried to debunk Falun Gong, and the most 
                fervent and successful of these must be Sima Nan, a kind of Chinese 
                James Randi who has made a career out of replicating &#145;miracles&#146; 
                and embarrassing self-styled qigong masters. Sima claims, interestingly, 
                that Falun Gong is not the biggest of China&#146;s many qigong 
                movements, even though it boasts 100 million practitioners (state 
                officials say 2 million). He estimates that another organization, 
                Zhong Gong, is probably the largest, with approximately 20 million 
                devotees. Sima has been beaten up by Falun Gong fanatics and is 
                not even especially liked by the government because of his penchant 
                for &#145;outing&#146; state officials associated with the movement. 
              </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Rael </p>
              <p>The Rael movement was started by &#145;Rael&#146;, a former race 
                car driver and sports journalist from France, who was contacted 
                by aliens in 1973. The aliens claimed to have created all life 
                on earth, and since mankind is now just beginning to crack the 
                secret of life, they decided the time was ripe for contact. In 
                Rael&#146;s universe, the aliens are like nice big brothers; they 
                harbour no evil intentions, and just want to make contact and 
                chat with their erstwhile creations. So Rael&#146;s mission is 
                to establish an &#145;alien embassy&#146; on earth to facilitate 
                the inter-planetary merriment. </p>
              <p>Recombinant DNA technology is one of the cornerstones of the 
                Raelian movement. Their website features a biochemistry timeline 
                and information about artifical life. Strangely, they have thrown 
                in some amazingly simple-minded arguments against neo-Darwinism; 
                for instance, they claim that since it has been proven that DNA 
                repair mechanisms exist (and it has, indeed), mutations do not 
                occur, and therefore evolution through random mutations becomes 
                impossible. Well&#133; </p>
              <p>The Raelian movement has, however, recruited a number of competent 
                biologists, and even started a Bahama-based company, ClonAid, 
                that aims to clone humans. Cloning yourself will set you back 
                $200,000, but you can also opt to clone your pet (using the CLONAPET 
                technology), which will be cheaper. You will also be able to clone 
                your children, in case anything happens to them, and if they have 
                a lethal genetic defect, they will be frozen until the tecnology 
                exists to deal with the problem. Thus, Raelians are also interested 
                in life-extension research and cryonics, and regularly invite 
                researchers from these areas to speak at their conferences. Incidentally, 
                they carry a link to the Transhumanist Society on their webpage, 
                and one can only speculate whether the interest runs one way or 
                both ways. </p>
              <p>But the movement is not all about science. It promotes a raucuous, 
                rambunctious attitude towards life, as expressed in the greeting 
                message on their web page: &quot;&#133;the most politically incorrect 
                and fearlessly individualistic philosophy of non-conformity&quot;. 
                Now that&#146;s what I call marketing. Many pseudo-religions could 
                benefit from this unabashedly libertarian appeal to its followers. 
                It certainly helps that the Raelian meetings are reported to be 
                a blast; fringe-science talks are intercut with &#145;sensual 
                meditation according to instructions passed down to Rael by the 
                aliens&#146;, meaning sex - the Swedish Rael site encourages participants 
                of the summer seminars to get a medical check-up and bring condoms. 
              </p>
              <p>So here we have a movement with a well-designed site (though 
                some of the links are dead), a happy-go-lucky approach to life 
                (the site states that the Rael movement is about &#145;seeking 
                fun and pleasure&#146;), and a heavy reliance on genetic engineering. 
                However, its customer base is still small, and its impact is nowhere 
                near Falun Gong, maybe because the latter has implemented tried-and-tested 
                Eastern belief systems so that a wide range of people can be attracted. 
                In short, Rael needs more market research. </p>
              <p>Which one is better? </p>
              <p><img src="images/029_clan2.gif" width="205" height="90"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After this presentation, we are sure that the intelligent, well-informed 
                citizen can easily make up her mind. But just for completeness&#146; 
                sake, let&#146;s state our own opinion. We feel that the accolade 
                for the most streetwise pseudo-religion has to be awarded to Rael. 
                Not just because it is smaller and &#145;fringier&#146;, but because 
                of its sheer brashness and total devotion to fun. It seems like 
                a regular happy mutant cult. Still, we would be eager to hear 
                the first reports of abuses; will they stalk droputs, for instance? 
                (On the other hand, who would want to exit such a fun-filled, 
                sensuous organization?) Falun Gong has the mass appeal, but is 
                simply too single-minded for the global citizen (aside from the 
                fact that Master Li has been making derogatory comments about 
                all non-Chinese people). It has the aliens, it has the levitation, 
                but it simply doesn&#146;t fly. If you still feel that Falun Gong 
                is your bag, may we suggest some desolate Taoist village in Taiwan, 
                or modelling your own cult in your home area based on the 6th 
                century Chinese hippie Taoists who dropped out, lived in the mountains, 
                practiced sexual magic, tried to make immortality potions and 
                drank wine and mercury. </p>
