      <p><img src="images/004_eccent.gif" width="320" height="73"></p>
      <p>You have probably seen one of these, one of the master eccentrics. Did 
        you know that most of them share a lot of common characteristics? Let's 
        take it from the beginning, shall we?</p>
      <p>There are some special behavorial traits that eccentrics often exhibit. 
        It's not the case that *every* eccentric shows all these traits, but it's 
        customary to claim at least 5 of these traits if one aims for eccentric-hood. 
      </p>
      <p>Normally, in the normal world, if someone changes, for example becomes 
        gay (or a sports fan), this person will show a lot of gayish traits (or 
        behave like the biggest jock in town) in the beginning just to proclaim 
        his/her new identity in a really loud and startling way. It's like, hey 
        it's me I've changed! </p>
      <p>That is not the way of the eccentric; it might start with something simple 
        like pissing in a teacup when the toilet is too far away, and then keep 
        the cup in the room (unawares at first, but later, perversely; perfectly 
        aware) until someone finds it. </p>
      <p>To become eccentric isn't some quantum leap, it's *evolution*! The eccentric 
        will gradually develop more and more eccentric traits until the day the 
        eccentric becomes aware of his/her eccentricity. (Known in magic texts 
        from the centuries past as &quot;Ilumination&quot;) </p>
      <p>Then the aim is to become a member of a secret eccentrics' club house 
        somewhere in central London, where arch-eccentric Methuselahs roam and 
        no &quot;norm&quot; has ever trod. What are these characteristics, then? 
        Let's consult the dictionary shall we? </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>An eccentric is someone 
        who has several of these characteristics:</b></font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Is possessed by knowing what the time is, eg. being aware of time. For 
        this reason he/she (more often a male for strange reasons) has an array 
        of watches proudly decorating both wrists. The eccentric also always sports 
        a pocketwatch. (rova -vad heter det egentligen?)</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Has a stuffed up owl on the shoulder when he (from this and on let's 
        face it, an eccentric is male) walks around the town.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Always lives in a small town, or outside the a big town in a creepy mansion.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Can walk perfectly but prefers to maneuver around the town in his wooden 
        weelchair. Once a year he starts eating raw eggs for breakfast for a week 
        and then he get's out of the wheelchair and participates in a marathon, 
        usually ending up among the fastest one hundred.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Hates to buy anything, the ultimate DIY gury. Makes everything from scratch.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Still believes the old Swedish April Fool's joke about stockings over 
        the televison. This was in the ancient times when colour television was 
        new, morning television said that if you put a woman's stocking over the 
        ray-tube of a black and white one you could see the colours. The eccentric 
        says: You have to look very closely.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Has a Babbit engine up and running and writes his memoirs on it. The 
        problem is (no problem for him though...) that it takes a very long time 
        to process each character. The eccentric says: You have to put great effort 
        into every little detail. Every word has to be carefully selected. Once 
        he wrote the wrong character, and since his primitive wordprocessor has 
        no &quot;undo&quot; or &quot;backstep&quot; he had to rewrite the whole 
        page, that took another 17 years.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Is one of the most productive writers of all times but he writes everything 
        in his own invisible ink and he hasn't figured out the developing formula 
        yet...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p>When he gets up in the morning he bakes a hat of bread, which he gives 
        his son to eat in the afternoon.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p>Has a son who sleeps in a paper box filled with papershreds from Papa's 
        paper document destroyer. (The eccentric is terrified of the idea that 
        someone might figure out the formula for developing his invisible ink.)</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p>Is a member of a secret London-based gentlemans club for eccentrics. 
        To become a member one has fist to be recommended by an active member 
        of the club, then to produce documents that prove ones eccentricness and 
        finaly to be approved of by a panel of arch-eccentrics.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/004_foetus.gif" width="20" height="30"></p>
      <p>Does these characteristics match yours? If not: remember to support your 
        local eccentric. </p>
