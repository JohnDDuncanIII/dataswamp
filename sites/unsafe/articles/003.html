        The nail, its epistemographical origins</b></font><br>
        In the beginning of this tale, a tale of crazed nail addicts and maddened 
        nail-intoxicated prophets, nail was just cloves. Plain, old good reliable, 
        cloves - the spice of spices, a spice to trust in. Then came a great man, 
        let's for simplicity's sake call him Todd. Todd was a wanker - a good 
        one for sure, perhaps the best of them all. Nevertheless, he was a wanker, 
        shunned by all of mankind for his views on the matter. He thought that 
        it was really OK to do his little trick in public, several times a day. 
        And did he enjoy it! No, he did most certainly not. He only used the wanking 
        as a vessel to propel him to the ecstatic high domains - and become as 
        gods.</p>
      <p>Then he learnt of nail, he sailed over the seas and ventured high into 
        the dragons daim and what did he find? Just outside the lair was a small 
        street stand where a Chinaman sold fresh nail to the peasants. He bought 
        some of the precious substance in exchange for some wheat he happened 
        to be carrying. He tried it in small amounts at first, he wasn't the one 
        to take heroic doses at first, as others have done. But then it hit him 
        hard anyway and he finally got really high - and became a god - not of 
        wankers - but for us; The Brethren of the Naily Pipe...</p>

        The substance, different qualities, preparations</b></font><br>
        Nail comes not in one form, but in many. If I was to tell you all the 
        different sorts it would become too tedious and I'd bore you all stiff. 
        After all, all you want to do is to get to that shop and by the stuff 
        and smoke it on the spot, right? Got you there...</p>
      <p>The fresh nail as we see it in the shops comes basically in two qualities, 
        ground and not ground. Then there's different brands around - I won't 
        give you any names here. We will certainly not sell out to any capitalism. 
        Nail is Todd's gift and it should be free to any WoMan! But one thing 
        I can tell you and one thing only. Asian nail's probably the best bet. 
        It is stronger, more potent and far better than the others. It's well 
        known that the farmers in third world countries don't get much for their 
        effort on the field, but hey! Do we care? I just want to hit that fresh 
        pipe of sparkling nail man!</p>
      <p>Ground nail: Not very good actually. The power is in the sauce as Tod 
        used to say, and there's much truth in that for sure! But it is not completely 
        worthless - it's still nail. And thats not a small thing...</p>
      <p>Plain nail: The best. The first thing you've got to do when entering 
        the world of nail is to buy your mortar - the nail addict's best friend, 
        save for the nail itself. The choice of a mortar is not a petty one - 
        one must put great effort and a sizeable amount of money on this most 
        important of all equipment. The nail must be ground to a fine powder - 
        or something like it. The thing is - the sauce has to get out (Todd there 
        again!). The sauce is the active ingredient in nail - it won't work without. 
        Yes, it's that stuff they put in your mouth when they're messing with 
        your teeth back at the dentists. Some people have NEVER recovered from 
        that! Talk about a bad setting - somebody is pulling your teeth out and 
        then the nail kicks in... Sad, sad, sad, some people never ever learn... 
        Small wonder so many people are afraid to go the dentist's!</p>
      <p>It's probably best to mix nail with some tobacco - works wonders for 
        that throat of yours. Some people let the nail and tobacco age together 
        for years in a sealed container, they say it's the best. Then when it's 
        properly mixed - roll a joint or hit the pipe. NOTE: if you only have 
        smoked marijuana, this is for real, this is nail. It's not a game anymore...</p>

        captain Clark tells us his view on the matter...</b></font><br>
        Approach nail with caution, the effects may be small at first, but if 
        you overdo it, you can find yourself somewhere entirely else ... in the 
        Nail Realm. Once you've been there, you can become one of its permanent 
        residents ... we have friends who have been unable to start their day 
        without smoking a pipeful of nail. That said, when you realize what it's 
        all about, nothing should keep you from smoking like a beast. You can 
        roll it up in joints if you want to, but I'm partial to the pipe - there's 
        nothing like the crackling sound of a fragrant pipe of industrial strength 
        nail. Beware; the smell of nail is very strong. If you don't want people 
        around you to notice anything - don't smoke. It contains strong aromatic 
        oils. (Ol' Sasha Shulgin has examined them, by the way, on his way to 
        discovering the methamphetamines.) So do it out of the way, or surround 
        yourself with people that don't care. It's not illegal, so what's the 
        problem?</p>
      <p>Once you start smoking, remember to inhale deeply. This gives a much 
        better effect. For beginners and intermediates, the inhalations can be 
        difficult and severe. But just persist, the reward is around the corner. 
        Medical sources tell us that smoking nail may be vey harmful to your lungs. 
        Make your own decision about it &amp; compare the pleasure you get from 
        nail smoking to the harm done to your body.</p>

        good techniques and tools but I'm not in charge. Being not in charge is 
        the big thing with nail. I'm certainly not in charge over the nail, no

        Longing for the pipe...</font></b><br>
        The longing for a pipe when short of the &quot;flesh of Todd&quot; is 
        one of the big things in this naily business. One has to long for the 
        nail in order to enjoy it when the transferation to the naily realm comes. 
        Many are the nights when the wail of the Brethren short of flesh can be 
        heard as a silent hiss in the night... Usually, every town has one store 
        that really beats all the other in quality and price. Often in the morning, 
        before the shop opens, naily men and women gather outside. They look shyly 
        into each others bloodburst eyes and sometimes they utter short sentences 
        full of anticipation in hushed voices... One of them paces the pavement 
        and occasionally kicks a stone to the other side of the road. Another 
        who can take this torture no more picks up a bunch of roaches and begins 
        to fill a pipe with what little that is left. Then the shop opens, people 
        scream their happiness in the morning air, and people rush in and soon 
        they couldn't be happier, walking home with a full 50g bag, perhaps rolling 
        a small one on the way home, really enjoying life to the max...<br>

        live for naught but nail; nail is their sole purpose for living. They 
        dwell at daytime in abandoned houses &amp; factories. They have their

        They are nail all over. They have gone too far in the way of nail, or 
        perhaps they have found a great truth beyond us. They have forgotten all

        posed if I were to be asked. They have given up totally on ordinary society, 
        nothing of it interests them, instead they gather people of similar belief 
        in gigantic nailfests in the woods. There they light up sky-high waterpipes 
        and sing nail's praise (they don't even know about Todd, and if they knew 
        they probably wouldn't care). They eat nail, smoke nail, smell nail, see

        Certain cultures at certain times use a hell of a lot of nail, at other 
        periods the amount of nail consumed is about zilch. What causes these 
        wild fluctuations? Why is not the amount of nail consumed constant, or 
        at least predictable, over time? That's beacuse the Nail Realm's influence 
        in this sphere of life fluctuates. Why does it fluctuate? Beacuse of the 
        strange laws ruling of the nail dimension, these laws are subject to evolvement 
        and so, they change over time. They are fractal as well and this makes 
        the changes over time rather profound and special. This amounts to the 
        strange fluctuations. So now you know it all.</p>

        A lot of people have started up on nail, expecting it to change their 
        life, and in a way it has. It has given them new meaning in life, nail 
        and only nail. But there are also some visionaries who are not satisfied. 
        They develop elaborate thought systems around the nail symbol. Some try 
        to go beyond nail, to seize the earth-rocking power of Toddflesh, and 
        be able to tap into it even when straight. Needless to say, this would 
        be one of the greatest transformations of human experience that have ever 
        happened, and the authors of this book are completely at a loss as to 
        how this would work.</p>
      <p>We stick to the nail instead. But meanwhile, there is work to be done 
        on several levels, to prepare for coming hells &amp; paradises ..</p>
      <p>We hereby proclaim the need for a mapping of the nail realm. Take this 
        as a manifesto, if you will. We need brave Nail-o-nauts to delve into 
        the very borderlands of thought. The maps will of course not be recognizable 
        as such by non-Nailers. They have to be as congruent as possible with 
        the nail experience, that is to say, twisted, ugly, beautiful and moving 
        in all directions. We need to know more about how the nail realm works.</p>

        There was a Buddhist long ago, who proclaimed truth to be more important 
        than everything else. Some people today say that the statement is not 
        properly translated. When the Nail Cults and Realms of olden times passed 
        into history and then were completely forgotten by everybody, the vocabulary 
        and the meaning of certain words also got lost. One of the words forgotten 
        was the word for Nail. That is: the true meaning and use of the word got 
        lost. The people living under this era of forgetfulness and despair vaguely 
        remembered the word for nail. They knew that the word was true. Nail is 
        true, and means truth in certain contexts. So the original word for nail 
        (which is now lost) came to mean truth, that was after the era of Nail 
        and complete happiness ended.</p>
      <p>So in our western culture, we have a rich basis of thought to draw from 
        when we think about Nail. Everybody in our culture will automatically 
        think of something true whenever they hear the word Nail. Consider the 
        myth of Crist. Perhaps the most important myth 'cept for Nail. Almost 
        everyone in the western world think there's at least some truth in the 
        myth, though that exactly what it is that is true is hard to pinpoint. 
        Well, in truth; it is not hard! The only truth in that myth is the nails 
        driven into Christ's hands and feet. It's just a simple example of the 
        fall that occured when people started to mix up the concepts: nail &amp; 
        truth. Some people wish to go further and analyse the myth further. Well, 
        I don't know if that is a good idea. But their main point is that it is 
        a myth about someone getting sacrificed (or totally hooked) on nail. And 
        there it goes, making more and more rubbish. Nail is just about hitting 
        the pipe and nothing less...</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The darkside of Nail</b></font><br>
        Some of the followers of Todd don't follow the path of righteous happiness 
        and truth; they follow the Dark Path of nail. Under their care, Nail becomes 
        something demonic, an ancient Egyptian god. They focus on the dark aspects 
        of nail, bring those forth and let it feed their hunger for unhappiness. 
        They choose to wear black or dark clothes. They come to live under constant 
        depression, feeling only the pain in the world and not the good and positive 
        side. Maybe these people are the real nailers, hitting the pipe harder 
        than anybody else. </p>
      <p>Though there are some really black nailers from Jamaica - who don't take 
        shit from anybody. They would probably laugh to death if they heard about 
        the Dark brotherhood of Nail, and if they met them, hell, they'd give 
        the pale and skinny kids a real beating. </p>
