      <p>Japanese consumer culture is in constant overdrive, a self-amplifying 
        machine that does not run on empty but instead is always growing new limbs 
        and forms. Signals from the street and from abroad are rapidly taken in, 
        absorbed, and modified. </p>
      <p>Foreigners sometimes sneer at Japanese consumers, saying that they simply 
        buy all the clothes they see in some particular picture in a British fashion 
        magazine, and that they have no style of their own. This is to fall into 
        a well-known trap, assuming that "authenticity" should somehow be the 
        guiding star of our lives.</p>
      <p>The Japanese consumers are not in the authenticity business. They have 
        no time to, because they have to keep up with the market, which changes 
        at lightning speed. Next week, another obscure clothes shop in Shinjuku 
        will be the rage. </p>
      <p>This rapid cultural scene makes for a fast evolution of trends, where 
        symbols and catchphrases scroll by at one thousand miles per hour. It's 
        no wonder that the hippest trendsetters in Europe (James Lavelle of Mo' 
        Wax for example) would be helpless without their regular dose of Japanese 
        pop culture. So what is it exactly that the Japanese know and we don't?</p>
      <p> It all comes down to hacking. Since the 1970's, guide magazines to entertainment 
        and leisure activities have been extremely popular in Japan. These magazines 
        (one of which is 'Pia') quickly became so powerful that people didn't 
        care for shows not listed in them anymore. Tetsuo Kogawa said (in the 
        late 80's!): "This type of magazine transforms the total reality of city 
        culture into fragments of information that one can assemble according 
        to one's preferences ('konomti'). And it goes to an extreme in which informational 
        reality is substituted for the substantial reality that everybody used 
        to experince." 
      <p> Thus, many readers began to the magazines just for "information play", 
        reassembling the data in them into various configurations. Many of them 
        have never even seen the listed shows; they are manipulating pure information. 
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="images/024_stock.jpg" width="327" height="53"> 
      </p>
      <p> This dissociation of information from concrete experiences makes possible 
        many new forms of creativity, and especially the ability to hack anything. 
        The'otaku' are well-known: (mostly) teenage boys who devote their spare 
        time to digging up obscure snippets of information about movie stars, 
        singers, or whatever; the less well-known, the better. 
      <p> In the same way, clothes or other fashion accessories are certainly 
        nothing else than symbols; something you can hack - try for a while and 
        then discard. The Japanese penchant for simulations also explain the wonderful 
        inventions they come up with - Tamagotchi and the handheld consoles where 
        you do battle with creatures who get their combat characteristics from 
        scanned barcodes are just two examples.&nbsp; 
      <p> Japanese noise music also reflects this tendency: while European noise 
        bands tend to have heavy and "important" agendas, Japanese artists like 
        Merzbow admit that their music has no message - it's just noise, and in 
        Merzbow's case, it's intended to be so violent that the listener's thought 
        processes stop completely. 
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="images/024_stenar.jpg" width="340" height="54"> 
      <p> Since the Japanese economy has been so strong, at least up until now, 
        capital has been abundant and available for young people through their 
        parents. Information in the form of capital has been massively invested 
        in information in the form of cultural artifacts, and as a result, street 
        culture has been flowering. What better use is there for money than converting 
        it to shiny, glistening cultural capital?
