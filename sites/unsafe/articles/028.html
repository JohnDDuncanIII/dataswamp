        INC. </p>
      <p>Briefing Draft. </p>
      <p>The goal of the Futant King line of furniture is to make tools and items 
        that force people into interaction with the abstract matematical lifelike 
        patterns of cellular automata. It's possible to have a rewarding meeting 
        with this abstract realm without knowing anything about it beforehand. 
        It's about non-life lifelike patterns that can react to human presence. 
      </p>
      <p>One of the questions that spawned this project was why architecture is 
        so dull. People and nature are merely bystanders in a 'perfect' architectural 
        world of blueprints and sketches. The problem is that architecture is 
        more a source of irritation than perfection. Poorly designed buildings 
        with walls that keep getting into the way, or public areas that make people 
        feel uncomfortable. Architecture should be like an interface where life 
        and lifeless matter meet. </p>
      <p>The possibility of embedded computation (and the possibility of developing 
        this technology by reusing old computers for homebrew projects) makes 
        it realistic to make furniture and architectural items that run cellular 
        automata patterns now, not in ten years. A feature of cellular automata 
        systems is that they can be made reactive (or interactive). By wiring 
        up sensors that manipulate the state of an individual cell it's possible 
        to make individual cells react to touch, or whatever weird means of communication 
        that is chosen. Connecting an old Macintosh, Amiga, or Atari to a set 
        of lights and sensors, programming the CA and setting up the computer 
        to load the CA on autoboot will result in a device that fulfills the wishes 
        of the Futant King Design Laboratories. Futant King Furniture aims to 
        create a series of rugged blueprints for cellular automata based furniture 
        during summer/fall 2000.</p>
      <p>Why do things in the real world when it's possible to do things in the 
        safe and protected-mode world of the computer operating system? Perhaps 
        it's about keeping it real, and making something that lasts longer than 
        a forgotten computer program. Of course it's possible to frame an old 
        laptop screen and hang it onto the wall, let it run a cellular automata 
        software, but then, it'd still be inside the computer world. The Futant 
        King design project is about literally dissolving the boundaries that 
        separate machine / life, computer / wiring systems, and human / architecture 
        from each other. </p>
      <p>Imagine a large, wired checkerboard floor installed in a sterile 80:s 
        atrium or in another public area. The bricks on the floor have two states, 
        they can either be white or black depending on the state of the neighbouring 
        bricks. The states are computed according to the rules of a special cellular 
        automaton called Conway's Games of Life. In this game, a cell with exactly 
        two neighbors survives. If it has more than 2 neighbors it dies from 'overcrowding', 
        and if it has less it dies from 'starvation'. The 'dynamic barcode' pattern 
        below is running a one-dimensional version of this rule, and so is the 
        'theme applet' of this issue (the one that appears right below the headlines 
        of all the articles.)</p>
      <p> <applet code="barcode.class" width="80" height="30" codebase="../java/">
        </applet> <br>
        Futant King </p>
      <p>Different patterns will run across the Life floor, domino effects initiated 
        by pressure input from standing or walking humans. A group of kids are 
        arguing with each other and jumping around in a corner of the floor, trying 
        to create a stable pattern, and to keep their pattern from being wrecked 
        by gliding patterns caused by people walking by. </p>
      <p><img src="images/028_futantchess.jpg" width="200" height="114"></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another usage for cellular automata would be interactive drinking tables 
        / chess tables or boards that compute Life patterns depending on where 
        the drinking glasses are placed. </p>
      <p>There's another form of simple interactivity that is being developed 
        at Futant King R&amp;D and goes by the name &quot;toggling&quot;. It's 
        a non-sequential approach to block-puzzle where the controls are unknown. 
        The aim is to de-toggle a complicated picture in the shortest possible 
        time, or in the most beautiful way. There's also toggling without a goal; 
        toggling for toggling's sake. Like meditation, but in a machinic kind 
        of way.</p>
      <p>In the future we can look forward to people sitting in their Cushicles, 
        looking at their wallscreen and toggling away at different patterns. Electronics 
        corporations will give away prizes for those who can de-toggle a particularly 
        demanding CA advert of say 300x300 cells. Finding the right combination, 
        or strange attractor that warps the image to a whole again, is a tough 
        job. Many are called, but few have the knack, free time, and devotion 
        that it takes to crack an AD-CA. A whole subculture, a subset of otaku 
        called togglers, dwells under the bright surface of the info-screen. Bulletin 
        boards sport elaborate hacks and reverse-engineering schemes for the ads, 
        and potent neural networks that can easily de-toggle them are mentioned 
        in hushed tones. </p>
