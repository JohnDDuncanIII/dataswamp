      <p>The importance of the Kakn&auml;s Tower is evident even for the accidental 
        visitor. The bus ride takes him through flashy &Ouml;stermalm and the 
        whole embassy area, where vast stretches of space open up on the left 
        hand side, containing only one object - the Tower. This area is called 
        &quot;The Eco-Park&quot; and it was chosen as the ideal place for the 
        Tower, according to ancient Swedish divination principles; a cross between 
        rune magic and Bismarckian welfare calculus.</p>
      <p>It can hardly be an accident that the Tower peeks over the perimeter 
        forest only 100 meters from the embassy of the People's Republic of China. 
        Keeping in mind the political atmosphere of 1967, when the Tower was opened, 
        it must have been only too convenient to give a couple of Red Guards from 
        the embassy an all-year pass so that they could monitor the activities 
        in the capital. It was believed that Sweden could learn much from China; 
        many children's books about hardworking farmhands were translated and 
        the Swedish educational system was actually heavily inspired by the Chinese 
        system of &quot;unauthoritarian education&quot; practiced during the cultural 
        revolution. </p>
      <p><img src="images/019_konstverk.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>The walls of the lobby are boiling with chaotic alien forms, which can 
        sustain the visitor's interest quite some time, while listening to the 
        clerks chattering in a bizarre form of pidgin Finnish, about 20 words 
        gleaned from some phrase book, to the desperate Finnish tourist groups 
        who try to explain that they only want to buy two Cokes from the pathetic 
        gift shop which spoils the majestic interior. The aliens are part of an 
        ambitious art installment called Spelrum Futurum (suggesting a space for 
        creative play in the future tense) by artist Walter Bengtsson, who explains 
        in an accompanying folder: &quot;The basic idea is man in the technological 
        world, where sending and receiving are in progress. (...) the figures 
        have some kind of arms or tentacles that grasp and grope. I was thinking 
        of the Russian astronaut who died in space. You can never trust the technical 
        aids. (...) The TV-tower is actually a kind of symbol of our time with 
        its enormous machinery, cables, etc. Nowadays, as we know, we do not build 
        cathedrals, but it can be said that this is a cathedral of our time.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/019_baulstrad.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>Bang on target. The Tower is a cathedral, a manifestation of early Swedish 
        info-society dreams. It is the hub of most of Sweden's radio and TV broadcasting, 
        a spider in its info-web. The concrete surface of the Tower is inscribed 
        with monotonous patterns, symbolizing the signals sent to and from Kakn&auml;s. 
        The Tower contains Teracom's operative centre, which connects and controls 
        all programs on the Swedish surface net. There are five satellite dishes, 
        connecting radio and TV signals to and from satellites. And right below 
        the dishes, the bed-rock accomodates the vast hall of Skyport Kakn&auml;s, 
        untiringly transmitting and receiving information. </p>
      <p><img src="images/019_kikare.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>The natural climax of a trip to Kakn&auml;s is to take the lift up to 
        the very top, at about 155 meters over the ground. The lift is somewhat 
        slow, 12 mph, so there is enough time to take a couple of deep breaths 
        and mentally reconnect with the glory days of the Tower. Once at the top, 
        it is advisable to skip the Scandinavian restaurant and go straight for 
        the view. From here, the whole city of Stockholm is at your mercy. There 
        are four sets of powerful binoculars (one of which works), and with these, 
        no intimate tete-a-tetes from &Ouml;stermalm's opulent apartments are 
        safe from your eyes. You could also get your kicks by stalking the workers 
        below, zooming in on their lunch boxes when they take a break from unloading 
        crates of black market cigarrettes in the bay. There is also a remote 
        control which would seem to give you the ability to puppet Stockholm City 
        according to your whim. </p>
