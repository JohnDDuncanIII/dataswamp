              <p><b>PA.</b> Tell us a bit about yourself. </p>
              <p><b>kode9</b>. You are speaking to kode9 polymedia through Steve 
                Goodman.</p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> What do you mean by Sinofuturism? How does this tie 
                in with Afrofuturism? (Wu Tang Clan?) We at Powerbase are very 
                into the &quot;martial world&quot; of Chinese legend, &quot;rivers 
                and lakes&quot; as a metaphor for adventyrous thinking, where 
                everything is of epic proportions.</p>
              <p><b>kode9.</b> The primary focus of kode9 polymedia is to map 
                and accelerate a hypercultural matrix currently engaged in some 
                kind of protracted war, eroding the sensory banks and channels 
                of the Occident. Kode9 follows 2 swerving lines which cut across 
                this matrix. These are otherwise known as afrofuturism and sinofuturism. 
                For kode9 they are more accurately termed afro-vorticism and sino-vorticism. 
                Why? Because kode9 is obsessed by turbulence. More specifically, 
                the art of war in the art of noise.</p>
              <p>Sinofuturism (or sino-vorticism as we have suddenly decided to 
                call it) really constitutes the abstract dynamics of the art of 
                war.</p>
              <p>On one level this is merely nothing more than an acknowledgement 
                that in cybernetic capitalism, classic Chinese martial concepts 
                of softwar, fluid organization and notions of 'survival far from 
                equilibrium' have seeped into the physics of everyday life (in 
                the military, business, guerrilla, audiotribes...etc). But the 
                issue for kode9 is not 'liquid' metaphors but liquid dynamics. 
                There are very precise microphysical processes involved in fluid 
                mechanics at the onset of turbulence...and what makes the ancient 
                Chinese and Japanese hydro-poetics and strategics more interesting 
                than a reading emphasizing metaphors is their recursive base physics, 
                their clear awareness that the cosmos is a system of nested vortices, 
                twisting with parallel processes on every scale.</p>
              <p>So there is a convergence here between surviving the acceleration 
                of hypercultural flows in cybernetic culture and a persistent 
                conceptual orientation tuned to the base turbulence of everyday 
                life and to the psycho-geographical warping which we are all undergoing. 
                It is a fascinating question why the last years has seen an explosion 
                in the conceptual recourse which the West is making to the Orient. 
                And so kode9 would take the rapid ultrabourgeois take up of Feng 
                Shui, Tai Chi, etc. not merely as some kind of cultural appropriation 
                of an alien culture but rather as part of a sinofuturist virus 
                which is sweeping across the Occident, to varying degrees infecting 
                the sensory orientations of everyone, from military and business 
                strategists to housewives, designers, junkies, console gamers, 
                office workers etc. And so what is interesting here is how all 
                this relates to what McLuhan called the Orientalization effect 
                of electronics, a species mutation for strands of humanoid life 
                into a virtuality which sees us not as Cartesian headcases inhabiting 
                weightless fields of pure vision based on literal criteria, but 
                is tactile, hypersonic and fundamentally vortical. Sinovorticism 
                subjects the dominant sensory hierarchy to a literal revolution 
                by subjecting the human organism to torque, so that limbs unravel 
                themselves, and as Kodwo describes, flee in all directions.</p>
              <p><img src="images/030_kode9image.jpg" width="283" height="61"></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And then there is the pop cultural resonances of a simultaneously 
                abstract and concrete sinofuturism. And it's here you start to 
                see that nodal point in the hypercultural matrix where sinofuturism 
                converges with afrofuturism, as in fact both were being rotated 
                by a single vortex inhabiting the future, now sucking us towards 
                it. Anyway with the strains of sinofuturism which have infected 
                hip hop, most notably the Wu Tang, we're talking about a vast 
                drug-audio-tech interface which includes martial art movies, computer 
                games and the micro-militarization of urban, especially audio 
                culture. We first saw signs of this in the sixties and seventies 
                with the US ghetto militarization converging with Maoist urban 
                tactics, and then the impact of films like Enter the Dragon on 
                audio culture generally with Scratch Perry's Kung Fu and Prince 
                Jammy's Dub Kamikazi. Out of all this stuff you start to get the 
                sense that producers and DJs are making this connection, the connection 
                between the guerrilla dynamics of martial arts, of 'fighting without 
                fighting', and at the same time a mode of navigating in a virtual 
                yet deeply viscous space.</p>
              <p>Then again sinofuturism could just be a fucked up barometer of 
                the gradual and turbulent rise of East Asia in the 21st century.</p>
              <p>So for kode9 when you start following the traits of sinofuturism, 
                you inevitably get sucked towards a version of cyberspace which 
                is acoustic, turbulent and haptic...and then you're already on 
                an afrofuturist line. In fact kode9 is basically concerned with 
                the topology of sinofuturism and afrofuturism; how they loop together 
                on multiple scales, from the numerological to sonic and so on. 
                So kode9 explores this hypercultural node or intersection. It's 
                really all about rhythm.</p>
              <p>So with afrofuturism or afrovorticism you have the most devastating 
                noise tacticians. But more interesting is the conceptual vorticism 
                of sonic fiction which Kodwo tracks. Afrovorticism is the celebration 
                of the glitch in the matrix, the accident. The glitch is treated, 
                as Lucretius would say, as the clinamen, a swerve away from the 
                laminar flow of metricity. As Kodwo describes in Motion Capture, 
                the producer nurtures the bug, builds a polyrhythmic information 
                architecture out of the patterns imminent to the glitch, its degree 
                of intensity and asymmetric potential. From the glitch emerges 
                a sonic fictional matrix webbing up the audio with its hype. </p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> What does the afrofuturist scene look like in Britain, 
                if there is one?</p>
              <p><b>kode9.</b> In the UK kode9's afrofuturism taps from two pools 
                of activity in this region of the Black Atlantic, both simultaneously 
                conceptual and sonic. One pool contains Kodwo Eshun's conceptotechnics 
                and Ccru's researches into the Hyper-C audio syndicate (here we 
                have the issue of the nested relation between sonic fiction and 
                what the Ccru term hyperfiction.). The other is populated by UK 
                underground hyperdub. Emerging properly just as the drugs turned 
                sour, the scenious of UK hyperdub spat out the audio war machines 
                which we now know as hardcore, jungle, drum'n'bass and 2step garage...</p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> We really really liked your datastreams, can we expect 
                more stuff like this soon?</p>
              <p><b>kode9.</b> You will hear much more regarding our Y2k datastream. 
                The coincidence of cyberhype and the non-event of the M-bug confirms 
                much about calendric conservatism and our deeply hyperfictional 
                cultural condition.</p>
              <p> <b>PA.</b> What is your take on the Syzygy numerology?</p>
              <p><b>kode9.</b> Now that is complicated. What is your take? </p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> We were kinda hoping that you would explain it to 
                us... To us, the Syzygy numerology seems like a very systematical 
                Burroughs-esque tool to destroy all dogmatic verbal systems. Powerbase 
                has been dedicated to the use and production of theory-infested 
                paradigms and systems like this. Things that fuck with perception 
                to figure it out, whilst thriving on the perverse kick of self 
                aware theory production; when you know you scripted that piece 
                of reality that you just experienced, only to feel that it is 
                a program running out of control, yer own renegade spawn. </p>
              <p>A lot of the american psychotech books like those by Robert Anton 
                Wilson and Tim Leary... their weak point is that they hype a very 
                anal-retentive control of the mind and its thoughts. Sort of the 
                mind as a happy little camp where everything has to be happy, 
                or perish. This old view of the mind as something to be cultivated... 
                well. We prefer the out of control test dept: to design our memes 
                at random, and letting them evolve as they like... </p>
              <p><b>kode9.</b> Well it goes like this. . .it has only been through 
                an unlikely series of coincidences that we ever came into contact 
                with the syzygy numogram. Basically kode9 was undergoing a series 
                of explorations into dub, remixology and the abstract transposition 
                of dub techniques and methodologies in realms aside from the audiosphere. 
                So we were exploring the numeric traffic which exists between 
                digital audio sequencing and electronic writing. While Burroughs 
                cut-up methodology stood as one version of what this might be, 
                especially when he talks in Electronic Revolution about the tactical 
                application of multiple sound sources to incite riots and textual 
                cut-up as a technique of encryption, it seemed that in the late 
                1990s what Burroughs was suggesting was deeply entrenched in the 
                operating system of normality. And it seemed to offer no account 
                of what Kodwo describes as &#147;putting writing on the second 
                deck and accelerating it&#148;. So instead of cut-up we were exploring 
                the application of breakbeat science onto text using a sort of 
                sampler methodology. . .with this move, the process of writing 
                suddenly demystified itself, revealing documents as tiny weather 
                systems of alphanumeric characters. So we would snatch a conceptual 
                break and glitch and nurture it, send it through a variety of 
                filters, timestretch it, pitch it up and down, chop it up, splice 
                it into various recombinations and so on. . .and were experimenting 
                with various techniques of numbering text, installing a complimentary 
                rhythm without either overcoding or metricizing it on the one 
                hand, or sending it into chaos on the other.</p>
              <p>Simultaneously, Ccru was exploring mechanomics, gematria and 
                the schizonumerics of digital reduction through the work of the 
                infamous Professor Barker. . .in order to develop their previous 
                work regarding flat numeric cultures which did not rely on a system 
                of belief in some transcendent entity but rather a certainty in 
                the immanent traits of number itself. There will be much more 
                regarding this appearing on the Ccru website soon. </p>
              <p>Anyway, the discovery of the Syzygy numogram was a coincidence 
                in the sense that it swept us all beyond some of the blocks which 
                constituted the problems I&#146;ve just mentioned; problems related 
                to the proliferation a &#145;counter&#146; culture, where the 
                numerical distribution of a population is coincident with its 
                mode of cultural production. The numogram contains superficial 
                similarities to the Kabbalistic tree of life in that both are 
                constructed as decimal diagrams, treat names as numbers, numerize 
                by digital reduction and cumulation, and map zones onto spinal 
                levels. According to the Ccru however, the Tree of Life stands 
                as a kind of arborescent and to some extent arbitrary variant 
                of the numogram. Ccru&#146;s work has also uncovered a hypercultural 
                matrix which connects the numogram to the I Ching. Both share 
                a basis in double-numbering systems, and there appears to be correspondences 
                between the time-circuits of the numogram and the hexagrams of 
                the I Ching. The convergences and divergences are detailed more 
                fully in Ccru&#146;s swarm 4 of abstract culture, DIGITAL HYPERSTITION. 
                In this volume we also see how the numogram converges with various 
                traits, e.g. recursive scaling, of African mathematics and this 
                is illustrated in 2 essays by Ron Eglash.</p>
              <p>The numogram, as with its better know counterparts just mentioned, 
                can be a dangerous tool in the wrong hands, as we have found out. 
                . .the hard way. Since its appearance in our midst, our strategic 
                alliances have been severely tested and our reality severely threatened. 
                But this was just fiction. </p>

              </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of the tension generated by the appearance of the numogram 
                have emerged endless channels. The SYZYGY event which the Ccru 
                held in Central London in Feb/March 1999 in celebration of the 
                numogram saw the production of nested numerical, textual (see 
                abstract culture swarm 4) and sonic matrices, which treated the 
                numogram as an abstract rhythmic system. For kode9, it was an 
                opportunity to design, with various producers from the Katasonix 
                kru, the central zone of the numogram with its currents and time-glitches 
                into an audioscape. This was the Nomo CD. And we had the chance 
                of remixing some rare source material from the Hyper-C audio syndicate. 
              </p>
              <p>. . .so what&#146;s our take on the Syzygy numogram. . .it&#146;s 
                complicated..</p>
              <p>In Abstract Culture swarm4, the strange case of Cecil Curtis 
                unfolds into a state of tropical jungle enduced Lemurio-psychosis, 
                &#147;I knew that I had in front of me a key that would unlock 
                all the secrets of my life. . .I was unravelled in this maze of 
                coincidences, and could do nothing but follow its threads forever.&#148; 
              </p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> A reading of most of the afro-futurist texts evoke 
                a strong visual response in the mind of the reader: do you know 
                of any films that are fucked up enough to illustrate their themes, 
                or is only the non-visual medium of music, visual enough? Is sampladelic 
                hyperdub music the only vehicle capable of carrying the information

              <p><b>kode9.</b> Well there has definitely been some key visual 
                events in recent years. We&#146;re now well into a phase where 
                breakbeat science, as an abstract machine is being rigourously 
                deployed in mainstream visual culture with all the asymmetry, 
                twitches, stuttering and nervous realignment. It a continuation 
                of hyperdub&#146;s celebration of glitch culture. So we have music 
                videos now which look like shoddy motion capture, where the trajectory 
                of bodies has been gridded but at low resolution so that the actual 
                vector is the equivalent of a pixelated graphic. You can get a 
                sense of this visual kinaesthetic when you try to watch streaming 
                video over an average net connection. . .you get a jarring effect 
                between your optical input rate and the way the video is compressed. 
                So there is a fascinating situation where Hype Williams&#146; 
                afrofuturism and its interface with US hip hop and R&amp;B is 
                simultaneously the bleeding edge of global audio-visual culture 
                and running MTV. There is no contradiction here, its just totally 
                viral. Its also pure cyberpunk, taking the clunkiness, the visual 
                malfunctions of the digital age and turning them into deeply infectious 
                psycho-sensory triggers. </p>
              <p>The obvious vision which appeals to kode9&#146;s hydraulic sensibility 
                however is the scene in the middle of Missy Elliot&#146;s &#147;She&#146;s 
                a Bitch&#148;, when the dubmarine cyborgs emerge from a jet black 
                ocean, shrouded by a swirling aquapocalyptic sky and start doing 
                the Hype Williams jitterbug. That&#146;s a stunning scene. Its 
                like hyperdub summed up in one sequence. . .distilled, rarified 
                liquid dystopia. . .that&#146;s what kode9 follows. Its also pure 
                Hyper-C. In that one sequence you see this polytendrilled hydraulic 
                Golem emerging where hyper rhythm converges with intensive liquid 
                flow. Digital turbulence. </p>
              <p>Sampladelic hyperdub isn&#146;t the only medium of transfer, 
                but it has certainly proved to be the bleeding edge of sensory 
                assault. </p>
              <p><b>PA.</b> A lot of the discourse here revolves around the loss 
                of control, like in Kodwo Eshun's essay Abducted by Audio where 
                the listener becomes just a puppet to the music; we also have 
                the books by Simon Reynolds which talk about new musical genres 
                like 'darkcore' or 'harshstep' growing out of the &quot;drugs 
                turning sour&quot; as you wrote, when the dancers are completely 
                at the mercy of their drugs. Is this loss of control to be understood 
                as a preparatory step, a process which will induce memetic mutations 
                allowing us to navigate in delinearized space (kind of like Tim 
                Leary's ideas about preparing for life in zero-gravity) or are 
                we talking about something else here? </p>
              <p><b>kode9</b>. We&#146;re not so interested in models of virtuality 
                based around zero gravity. . .not transcendence and weightlessness. 
                . .the virtuality we are describing has is viscous. . .. . .sticky 
                and sometimes cerating. . .the real memetic mutations take place 
                transdermally, distributed across the skin as opposed to out of 
                the skin. Bio-technically we are definitely in a serious transition 
                phase towards deep polymedia, but its maybe more useful to characterize 
                the preparatory inititiation less in terms of the either/or of 
                &#145;control&#146; and &#145;out of control&#146;. Maybe possession 
                is closer to it, where crusted over glands, limbs or organs get 
                activated, switched on, and you start to get a sense of &#145;what 
                a body can do&#146; when the human security system is subjected 
                to torque and starts to fall away. It is very Spinozistic. Culturally 
                we are still shaking off the often dreary dual legacy of the hippy 
                and the artist, a legacy which romanticises a loss of control, 
                but actually continues to resonate within the game of control. 
                And there is usually a black hole or a padded cell waiting. It 
                also strikes us as a very male model of desire. We&#146;re more 
                interested in plateaus of intensity than nose dives. </p>
              <p>What is more interesting about darkside hyperdub has been that 
                actually there are very precise mechanisms involved in unpicking 
                control architectures. It&#146;s more like a ritual of rhythm, 
                which stretches from microscopic to global scales, from production 
                techniques hacking the metricity of the audiosphere, to crowd 
                turbulence and global proliferation. And because all of these 
                processes are more ritualistic than just purely &#145;out of control&#146;, 
                then you get prototypes of sustainable systems emerging as opposed 
                to &#145;crash and burn&#146; subculture. So where darkcore connects 
                with desire is not necessarily through the inducement of a loss 
                of control, but rather the feeling that you&#146;ve entered a 
                whole new game with its own rules. There&#146;s a classic line 
                in &#145;Abducted by Audio&#146;, the last line in fact where 
                Kodwo describes the fear/pleasure circuit of hyperdub. . .&#148;It&#146;s 
                like you entire body would like to vacate. Basically, you want 
                to go AWOL, from yourself. But you can&#146;t, so you stay and 
                enjoy it.&#148; That&#146;s it exactly. It&#146;s the tao of turbulence.

              <p><b>PA.</b> What are kode9s current research interests?</p>
              <p> <b>kode9.</b> Kode9 is currently in an intensive sound production 
                phase and there will be releases probably later in the year. But 
                there is a whole batch of mp3 stuff which will be uploaded in 
                the next few months. At the moment we&#146;re tracking an interesting 
                dynamic. . .the latest instalment of UK hyperdub is strikingly 
                similar to one which started occurring about 6 years ago when 
                early jungle converged with techno and sprayed off into multiple 
                directions, with one strain of darkcore which we now know as the 
                techstep-neurofunk-riffstep thread, which Simon Reynolds is always 
                slagging off, asserting a strange hegemony on the scene. Perhaps 
                there is a parallel dynamic occurring now as a convergence occurs 
                between 2step garage(which is dominating London pirate radio) 
                and the less than fantastic nu school breaks scene. Only this 
                time it&#146;s occurring at 135bpm as opposed to 175bpm. So kode9 
                is trying to simultaneously pre-empt and sidestep this fusion, 
                and the sound we&#146;re moving towards is probing the potential 
                for putting speed back into the 2step sound, without sucking out 
                all the juice, as techstep did to jungle. . </p>
              <p>We are also working with material from the Hyper-C audio syndicate 
                and there should be a release some time next year. Ccru are writing 
                a pulp horror novel, and her sister company Abstract Machines 
                is in the process of turning aspects of the Syzygy numogram into 
                a computer game design, and there is loads of material about to 
                hit the Ccru website regarding the abstract machine of hype as 
                the fundamental process of technoculture. </p>
