      <p>What can we possibly say, when everything has been said? Everything! 
        We have access to a massive information dump of everything that has been 
        written, or recorded and broadcasted on TV.</p>
      <p>Problematic as it can be, the fact that everything has been said doesn't 
        cut out the possibility of saying something new. We aren't ever gonna 
        run out of ways of combining those age-old words of wisdoms that have 
        been repeated in oh-so-many ways. Despite this, however, most of the information 
        exchange that takes place these days are highly ritualized TV / Media 
        spectacle.</p>
      <p>Standard Scenario: Cultural debate program: interview 12 people for approx 
        2 hours each - cut out a few well-chosen sentences, totally out of context, 
        from each interviewee that match the broad-cast network's current sociopolitical/financial 
        mesh status and end up with a lame 5 minute reportage that says absolutely 
        nothing. </p>
      <p>In the age of the post-modern miracle, this leaves us with an array of 
        left-over material, things that never get said on the aether, immense 
        resources of material that never gets face time. What gets face time is 
        primordial signifiers, memes that carry so little information that they 
        work in a totally different department. Memes that have been fossilized 
        a long time ago, and are now so thoroughly reverse-engineered that they 
        now function as important push button social (or hive-) control devices.</p>
      <p>How can it be true that criminality is on the increase? In the entirety 
        of my 27 year old life, hive machinery has toted the alert that criminality 
        is escalating and morality is on the decrease, but I have not seen that 
        development. Things are bad, yes, but it's just a basic state of the world. 
        What is true, however, is that panic signals are a control device that 
        works. Input panic signals of bourgeoise distress, and increase the bourgeiose 
        mindset. The bourgeuoise is a self-replicating virus, a feedback loop 
        that keeps itself going, whose main feedstuff is moral panic and self 
        preservation. Not that I care, that lifestyle will outlive me for centuries, 
        I am not interested in that sphere of life. Although in a way it might 
        be necessary to have a moral majority, they should be tightly controlled 
        and not get out of hand, and start killing off poor people, or killing 
        or sterilizing mentally defective people as they tend to do with frequent 
        intervals.</p>
      <p>Back to the main narrative... so we have seen that only an extremely 
        limited part of the great mass of information ever gets on the air. Probably 
        more diversified selections of that intellectual &quot;database&quot; 
        are written down in books. The Internet is an interesting variety of this 
        information extraction procedure; on the net, certainly a more diversified 
        version of the great library of form is presented. Now you might ask &quot;what 
        is the library of form&quot;, it's a notion of wack writer Borghes, of 
        a large library which contains all information in the world. The library 
        contains all possible mutations of a text - it can be long or short, it 
        can be totally intelligible or totally unintelligible. It would be possible 
        to create a library of form with a simple randomizing device connected 
        to a typewriter. If the typewriter typed forever you could find *any* 
        possible text in there. You could find the current version of the Iliad, 
        as well as the original Hellenic script, you could find lost transcripts, 
        books that never have been, or will be written, in short: every possible 
        and impossible version of every text.</p>
      <p>Now we don't have the datapower to handle such an infinity yet, but the 
        mass of current written material contains a lot of stuff. Enough stuff, 
        in fact, that it's highly likely that if you say and write something, 
        some anal bastard can track something similar down to what a fat monk 
        wrote in the 13th century, or to what some Neo-Manicheaist scholar wrote 
        in medieval China, or some of the &quot;great&quot; western philosphers 
        wrote in their tomes. So you cannot say anything that hasn't been said 
        before. A primitive solution to this problem is the cross-discipline pomo 
        cut and paste writing that was a western fad during the latter part of 
        the last century. There are several problems with that approach. The first 
        problem is that the narrative of the scholar doing that type of writing 
        is never threatened. She or he is just selecting things with a history, 
        and intertwining them into a new piece of writing. The notion of originality 
        and backtracking of memes is completely useless when everything has been 
        said so many times. If, for example, Kant, said something first, then, 
        every time this piece of intellectual copyright is used, the ghost of 
        Kant will be present, and enforce a Kantian understanding of the piece 
        'o information. Problem is that the same piece of intellectual bullshit 
        can be interpreted, equally enlightening, from an infinite array of paradigmatic 
        positions. With the history function turned on, writing can only work 
        to enforce old and outdated paradigmatic understandings and positions. 
        This is, of course, a natural byproduct of the bourgeouise world where 
        western-style research comes from.</p>
      <p>This leaves us with a freedom to understand the data-space of the world, 
        its written records and recordings, as a basically historyless data-dump 
        that has been placed on us to parse by uncaring superiors. The weight 
        of the history of the datamesh is so immense that it can crush us in an 
        instant, but the history is actually just make believe smoke &amp; mirrors 
        intended to hide the fact that there's no intrinsical history; the words 
        and sayings actually don't convey history any more, perhaps except for 
        the latest month's spoon-fed custodial media imprints from newspapers 
        and the telly. But that data isn't persistent - when media focus changes 
        so do our values. We forget what has been, and remember only the present.</p>
      <p>So, stop name-dropping, just steal ideas and forget who you stole from, 
        revert only to mentioning names when you want to bring into focus the 
        reality-nimbus of that person, or invoke a certain worldview. In other 
        cases, keep shut, and grab all the data that you can carry from the unguarded 
        safety vaults of the past and put together the texts and media of your 
        desire.</p>
