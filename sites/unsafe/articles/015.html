      <p align="LEFT">We had a hard time in front of us, and we were happy about 
        it. The time in China had made us appreciate hardship. When every day 
        is boot-camp test day, the best way to deal with it is to look at it with 
        humor and eventually you find yourself actively making life as challenging 
        as possible. </p>
      <p> The floods had been a hassle that year in China, the old Yangzi river 
        had been all over the valleys several times and the rains just kept falling. 
        We had to take a train to Canton in order to make it to Hong Kong for 
        the time of our appointed flight back home, which was due in less than 
        a week. 
      <p> For two days we waited for the latest flood to clear out and the railroads 
        to be repaired, when this grew less and less likely and our time was rapidly 
        running out we decided to chance on a busride instead. We had to take 
        the trip in two legs, the first one from Kunming to Nanning and then continue 
        on from Nanning to Canton on another bus. According to the guidebook the 
        trip to Nanning could take as much as 30 hours and most people avoided 
        taking this route because of that. We were pretty used to long busrides 
        by then and we thought it would be cool to take a really<i> long </i>busride. 
        So we bought our tickets and climbed aboard. 
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="images/015_bus.jpg" width="358" height="233" alt="Typical bus interior">
      <p align="left">As usual, the bus did not leave the station on the appointed 
        time, it took one hour for the bouncers to scavenge enough passengers 
        to completely fill the bus. The bus was a "sleeper" with seats/beds that 
        were long enough for the majority of the Chinese population but surely 
        not for us. We got places in the back end of the bus and the top beds. 
        Unfortunately, as we soon noticed these were the worst seats possible, 
        it shook <i>mightily</i> when the bus raced forth at breakneck speed over 
        the unpaved roads. 
      <p align="left"> We were just about to leave the suburbs of Kunming behind 
        us as my seat collapsed when the bus hit a big bump in the road. I flew 
        down and then up in the air, all the 50cm to the ceiling. My forehead 
        made first contact and there was a big crack as I felt my spine giving 
        in to the full kinetic power of the rest of my body. I lay down, sweating, 
        trying not to panic, wondering what I should do. I didn't have much choice 
        but to lie still and wait. 
      <p> One of the last things we passed as we left the outskirts of Kunming 
        was a run-down hospital building where some of the windows were broken 
        and the white paint was stained and cracked, people in white clothes were 
        milling about in the yard. I knew for sure that my decision to wait with 
        hospitalization until Hong Kong was right. My neck didn't feel to bad, 
        considering the blow it had taken. The only thing was that I could not 
        move the neck too far left or right, or I would instantly be punished 
        by a severe pain. Soon I had taken a big toll out of our ephedrine stash, 
        which is the local prescribed cure for light colds. I figured it would 
        keep me up for a while and I didn't want to fall unconscious in case of 
        a concussion. 
      <p> Eventually, after some 18 hours of endless transportation, we came upon 
        a muddy road where we hit some traffic jams. From then and on, we crept 
        forward. The heat was immense and we were heavily recycling the humid 
        air inside the bus. My neck was getting better, but during the long eat-stops 
        that the bus had made we had managed to spend most of our money. The bus 
        also broke down several times. As the bus slowly rolled into Nannings 
        shantytowns some 40h after we started out from Kunming we thought that 
        our trials were over. 
      <p align="left"><img src="images/015_mopeder.jpg" width="356" height="250" alt="Street vista from Nanning">
      <p align="left">How wrong were we not! Our trials had just begun. We quickly 
        found the ticket office and bought a ticket to Canton, and after that 
        we had just enough money left to buy us a nice little meal at "American 
        Fried Chicken", the only decent fast food restaurant in town, or so we 
        thought... The hamburgers tasted of dog-meat and the cockroaches behaved 
        like they owned the place. 
      <p align="left"> My friend took a trip to the bank of China which, according 
        to the guidebook, was supposed to take VISA cards. That was WRONG. The 
        squirmy little clerk told him that the only bank in town that took VISA 
        was the main office a couple of blocks south. Unfortunately we had spent 
        most of our allotted 1h stop so we had to go on travelling with a grand 
        total of 4$ in our pockets. 
      <p align="left"> We ran to the bus station and just got on in time. The 
        bus was not yet full, so we spent a miserable 2h until the bus eventually 
        left. The bus was spacious and we got some good places in the middle of 
        the bus on the lower bunks. This meant that the cigarette ashes of the 
        smokers upstairs fell down on us, but this was no problem for us anymore. 
        As the bus was making good pace getting out of the mazeways of the suburbs, 
        we suddenly heard the busdriver's wife yelling in a high-pitched tone. 
        THUMP - THUMP - THUMP - we had run over a female bicyclist at full speed! 
      <p> The bus screeched to a slow halt, dragging the mashed woman with it, 
        backed up a few meters when the police came (they happened to pass moments 
        after the accident). After something like 10 minutes, the woman was carried 
        into a police van and they drove away at high speed with the (seemingly) 
        lifeless, blood-covered body. Soon there was a plethora of policemen (and 
        policewomen) scurrying over the small bridge on which the bus now stood 
        halted. They videotaped and drew a minute detail sketch of the scene of 
        the accident. 
      <p> We were told to leave the bus after about half an hour, and 2 hours 
        later a new bus came to pick us up. This bus did not stop very often, 
        but when it did, we had half an hour to rest and eat. Sometime around 
        4 in the morning, when my friend had been trying all possible ways of 
        relieving his bladder (the window, plastic bags, bottles...) to no avail, 
        we decided to ask the bus driver to stop for a pee break. He did this 
        and we got off the bus into the darkness, where my friend soon found himself 
        lost in the shrubbery and up to his knees in mud. 
      <p> After 28 contemplative hours on the tropical road, we finally found 
        ourselves in the outskirts of Canton. When the bus stopped right outside 
        a banking office, we decided to chance it and get off there instead of 
        at the busterminal. 
      <p> The banking personnel were friendly but had no cash for us. There was 
        only one place that accepted VISA, a downtown hotel. We had spent most 
        of our money on roadside snacks, but, amazingly, we managed to scrounge 
        enough money for the bus downtown. From the local bus station we found 
        our way to the hotel, and the transit was swift and effective. 
      <p> When we bought our tickets to HK my back started itching, I didn't think 
        much about it at the time, but soon it had grown into a full grown Kundalini 
        dragon that was flaring away at full power under my skin as soon as I 
        started sweating. I had contracted a bad case of "prickly heat". On the 
        train to HK we were, for the first time in months, the dirtiest people 
        around. 
      <p> I cannot fully describe the joy I felt at leaving China, and as the 
        beautiful skyline approached us as the train <i>silently</i> made its 
        way to the world's most beautiful city. We crashed in a no-name hotel 
        in the Chungking Mansions, a shitty high-rise that holds 80 hostels and 
        a bazaar at the bottom level. Still, it was the height of luxury for us.
