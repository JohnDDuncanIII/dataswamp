      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When I first visited 
        Shanghai, I was actively looking for Ballardian settings &amp; trying 
        to soak up the heavy &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;-atmosphere which permeated 
        the city. After a few days, I felt somewhat exhausted by sensory overload, 
        and returned to my quiet base in Beijing. The day after I came back, I 
        decided to take a little stroll in a park near my house. It was then that 
        I realized that I wasn't making up the Ballardian landscapes myself. They 
        were pursuing me!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Either something 
        strange is going on or Ballard's vision is even more on target than I 
        ever thought. Everywhere you go it just hits you in the face. I would 
        like everybody to read at least three or four books by Ballard, keep his 
        descriptions and language close to heart while going about their everyday 
        business. Would they also confirm my findings - that Ballard's books are 
        the best road map we have of the world we live in today, despite some 
        of them being over 30 years old? </font></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="images/018_ghosttrain.jpg" width="363" height="236" alt="A typical ghost-ride "></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Now, what about 
        that park in Beijing? I'll tell you. It is a half abandoned park in "Chaoyang 
        Tourist Area", a place where no tourist has been spotted since the Ming 
        dynasty. The paved paths in the park are flanked by all sorts of junk. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The main attraction 
        is a lake, which is so polluted that the water close to the shore is almost 
        solid. On the other side of the lake, you can enjoy the sight of a huge 
        Bucky-ball (like those C60-molecules, you know) with loads of pipes attached 
        to it. A beautiful spectacle. Further ahead, there is a cliff formation, 
        quite nice in itself, but the disturbing thing about it is that somebody 
        has carved twenty or thirty bizarre-looking monkeys out of it. The monkeys 
        have been neglected, and so many of them have lost parts of their head 
        or arms. Imagine the sight of a white cliff formation overrun by mutilated 
        monkeys. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Next, you can climb 
        a small hill whereupon are built two quaint houses in Classical Chinese 
        style. From the hill, you have a nice view over the surroundings, consisting 
        mainly of ramshackle huts and a narrow, polluted river. But wait ... What 
        was that moving over there? Something furry in a run-down stall by the 
        riverside. You presumably venture down from the hill, since there is nothing 
        special up there anyway, at least now you have the chance to encounter 
        organic life. </font></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="images/018_dragon.jpg" width="357" height="232" alt="Another type of ghost-ride entrance"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When you approach 
        the stall, you see that two ragged camels are standing there. They seem 
        not to have been cared for in a couple of years. They are skinny and authistic, 
        they don't even react when you offer them some food, just stare at you 
        with big bottomless eyes like dirty sphinxes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At this point you 
        might already want to leave the park. You steer toward the entrance, and 
        pass a couple of dumbly staring, idle sanitary technicians on the way. 
        The last glimpse of the park is a couple of very plastic/antique- looking 
        statues of Chinese gods and goddesses.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Nobody will miss 
        you or remember you after you have left.</font></p>
      <p> <i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I hereby nominate 
        Chaoyang Park in Beijing as a candidate for the development of a J G Ballard 
        Theme Park. Don't miss it!</font></i></p>
