      </div>
      <p>The airport lies slightly north of Stockholm City, although well within 
        the urban area. Here, garden suburbs mix in with small industrial areas 
        in a pattern standardized 50 years ago. Public transport to Bromma is 
        kind of funky: first take the subway and then find the hidden bus stop 
        and jump aboard the good old 110 which will take you straight to liftoff. 
        Or, rather, after about half an hour of slow progress among the residential 
        districs, picking up aged members of society who moved here in an age 
        when it was considered a good idea to live near a big airport. The state 
        of public transport tells us a good deal about what we are about to enter: 
        a remote area, a redundant part of the communal cityspace.</p>
      <div align="LEFT"> <img src="images/020_skylt.jpg" height=194 width=295></div>
      <p>Near the airport, the ground that probably held big hangars in the good 
        old days now harbours a big array of supermarkets. A plain of parking 
        lots make up the perimeter area towards the airport. I get off the bus 
        one stop earlier, just to be able to approach the airport on Shanks's 
        pony. On the left hand side of the road is a big map, marking out the 
        different areas.</p>
      <p><img src="images/020_lampa.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>The security seems to be intense: flashing lights, bars and iron nets 
        guard the sacred grounds of Bromma airport. Later, when I take photos 
        in the main hall, I am approached by a guard asking me why I'm taking 
        photos. I explain that it's for an artwork, and ask if there's some prohibition 
        against shooting here. He says no, and asks if I am here for the architecture; 
        I say yes, and he says &quot;They're all here for the architecture!&quot; 
        and walks away. I wish I had said what was really on my mind: &quot;I'm 
        here to catch yo' big ol' stoopid Norse face in its natural environment&quot;.</p>
      <p><img src="images/020_fonster2.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>The main hall is not very big. The upper part of the walls are windows 
        made of stained plexiglass that once was the height of fashion. The windows 
        give the hall an eerie lighting; time seems more stagnant than ever. The 
        grey, filtered light shines down on the obscure travel agencies, the closed 
        shops and exchange counters.</p>
      <p><img src="images/020_dataskylt.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>A defunct touch-screen ticket vending machine has a central placement 
        in the hall. Close by there's a crowd of cabdrivers, and as I pass them 
        I hear them discussing mafia-related crime. There's a few travel agencies 
        and a dining area. But the thing that catches my eye is the small shop 
        in one of the corners of the building.</p>
      <p>The resident kiosk hawks interesting goodies, like spray paint against 
        robbery and a multitude of security gizmos - the world outside Sweden 
        is known to be extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p><img src="images/020_glasogon.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>Multicolored pilot eyewear from the heyday of aviation are also for sale. 
        As I browse the small shop I notice that the customers belong to one of 
        two different tribes; the businessmen here to take a domestic flight, 
        and aged overweight aviation buffs. Both types are drawn to the shop by 
        the effective shop window display: a model of a human head wearing a pilot's 
        intercom unit as well as the sturdy glasses which seem to be the shop's 
        main item and pride. I wonder, though, what do the business men actually 
        do with the eyewear: do they put them on and ask to be let into the cockpit 
        later on their flight, or are they just souvenirs of a past age? The aviation 
        buffs walk around with their glasses hangin' loose round their necks at 
        all times.</p>
      <p><img src="images/020_toalettskydd.jpg" height=194 width=295> </p>
      <p>After a while I think it's time for a dump so I locate the john, and 
        to my delight, the toilet sports a dispenser for protective toilet-ring 
        sheets, and not only that, the dispenser is well stocked. I thought toilet-ring 
        protection sheets were officially discontinued in the mid-80's. So I happily 
        pull one out, sit down, and enjoy the anachronistic vibes, so characteristic 
        of the Bromma airport.</p>
