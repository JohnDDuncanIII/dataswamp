      <p>Science fiction literature and culture are on the rise again in China, 
        for the third time this century. Originally introduced to the Chinese 
        audience by literary giants such as Lu Xun and Mao Dun, who translated 
        works by Verne and Wells into Chinese at the beginning of the century, 
        the genre remains strictly defined the works of these two authors, representing 
        the "hard science" vs. "psychological" directions of SF. </p>
      <p><img src="images/018_sida.jpg" width="198" height="271"></p>
      <p>Although famous writers like Lao She (in "City of cats") tried their 
        hands on this new kind of literature, the first boom for native SF would 
        have to wait until the 1950s, when the optimism of the new Communist society 
        coupled with fresh influences from the Soviet Union produced the first 
        specialized SF writers.</p>
      <p>At this time, the books were written mostly for kids, in order to get 
        them interested in science. The authors themselves had bigger plans. Zheng 
        Wenguang, "the father of Chinese SF", says that in those days, "us youngsters 
        all wanted to go to Mars". </p>
      <p>This youthful exuberance was promptly crushed by the Cultural Revolution 
        (appr. 1966-1976), and not until 1978 would new science fiction begin 
        to appear. This marked the beginning of what is considered to be the Golden 
        Age of Chinese science fiction. After the fall of the Gang of Four, Mao's 
        death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese thirsted for 
        new influences, foreign or otherwise. This led to the blooming of SF literature; 
        more than 800 stories were published during the following years. They 
        even made an SF movie, the semi-turkey "Death Ray on Coral Island". </p>
      <p><img src="images/018_ufo.jpg" width="283" height="389" alt="Coverpage for &quot;The Journal of UFO Research&quot;"></p>
      <p>In 1983, it was time for Party intervention again; the Campaign Against 
        Spiritual Pollution came underway. SF writers were condemned and ridiculed 
        for "propagating quack science". One of them, Ye Yonglie, was criticised 
        for a story about scientists who find an ancient dinosaur egg in a volcano, 
        and then manipulate it with chemical techniques so that it can be hatched. 
        The story was considered to be a prime example of "false science". Ironically, 
        in 1995, a group of biochemists from Peking University began extracting 
        dinosaur DNA from an egg collected from the same province. They are hoping 
        to reconstruct the dinosaur's genome, which, of course, would enable cloning. 
      <p> Today, SF blooms again, and this time around it's starting to look very 
        interesting. The young writers of today are not afraid to juggle new memes 
        around; they have tackled subjects like VR, nanotech, cloning, hackers 
        who become viruses zooming around a CPU, and qigong masters who communicate 
        telepathically with aliens, amongst other things. Admittedly, few really 
        good works have surfaced, but look to Xing He's and Wang Jinkang's twisted 
        tales and you'll see minds bursting with ideas, permutating all the implications 
        of contemporary science, struggling to fit it all into a form that would 
        match the quality of the content. When that happens, the results will 
        definitely be worth checking out. 
      <p><img src="images/018_sfw.jpg" width="198" height="271" alt="Cover page for &quot; Science Fiction World&quot; 97.11"> 
      <p> SF fan clubs and zines are also appearing at breakneck speed. One of 
        the strongholds seems to be Sichuan province, where China's biggest SF 
        magazine (Science Fiction World), with a circulation of over 250.000/month, 
        is based, a big convention was held a couple of years ago, and short story 
        competitions are arranged for school children, who have managed to come 
        up with amazingly imaginative material. 
      <p>Chinese SF is finally starting to cast of its pop science shackles and 
        asserting itself as a unique literary form in its own right. As with the 
        rise of almost every subculture, there are scare stories; Chinese newspapers 
        have reported of teenage suicides caused by excessive reading of science 
        fiction literature. Kids in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere have begun 
        to dream about careers beyond the farms or factories to which their parents 
        were doomed; they want to construct space cities or design supercomputers. 
        Some colleges have started offering SF courses as well, taught by key 
        figures from Chinese SF circles. 
      <p> The definitions of, respectively, SF and Chinese SF, were hotly debated 
        in Beijing last year, where a World Science Fiction Convention was held 
        to the delight of many Chinese SF fans. Authors from the mainland, Taiwan 
        and the USA (some of these overseas Chinese) offered their own viewpoints 
        on the origins and development of the genre. A Taiwanese author claimed 
        that the Taoist classic "Liezi" contained descriptions and time travel, 
        and found evidence for biotech/cloning themes in "Journey to the West". 
        He called for the publication of a compilation volume with all the Chinese 
        proto-SF throughout history.
