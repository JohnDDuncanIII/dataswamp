      <p align="LEFT">Spending those long days in the suburban landscape of Beijing 
        made me want to learn more about the alien buildings and the people that 
        inhabited the module-based highrises that rose like oil-stained grass 
        in the unmowed lawn that made out the capital of China. </p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="images/017_kina_svartvitringroad.jpg" width="358" height="250"></p>
      <p> The serious jet-lag from Europe made me wake up at 4 am the first weeks. 
        I could not go to sleep again in the hot fetid air. Instead of sweating 
        in bed I used the morning hours for long walks in the city-space that 
        surrounded the worn-down campus where I lived. Even though the area was 
        definitely urban, there were vast areas of farmland and swamps that cut 
        into the city. Often this was were the humming power lines went, gradually 
        even these secluded areas were giving way to low slum buildings, shantytowns 
        built on swampy ground. 
      <p> I also took long walks during the not-so-hot afternoon, mostly out of 
        boredom, but also out of curiosity. The concept of "a nice area", which 
        makes us Westerners clean and repair the facades of the buildings neighbouring 
        a newly built mall (or other monumental architecture) was clearly not 
        <i>en vogue</i>, only the new buildings themselves were clean and fresh. 
        The buildings next to the new shopping-center Modern Plaza, dated from 
        the time of the Cultural Revolution, were as dirty and shitty as ever. 
      <p> Some parts of Beijing, known as "hutongs", look like they did a hundred 
        yeards ago. Once, most of the people in the capital lived in hutongs, 
        and it's still the most preferred type of accomodation, not that everyone 
        can afford to live in one of them. These days only the moderately rich 
        can afford a house in a hutong. A hutong is what we in the West would 
        call a block of chain houses. A hutong most often takes up a whole city 
        block (it IS a whole city block in the mindscape of the Beijing urbanite), 
        and all of the buildings are built together, maybe to save the precious 
        brickstones that they are made of, or to make a collective statement of 
        about society. 
      <p> The one-story hutongs are penetrated by a maze of narrow gangways and 
        passways that constitute both sewer and route of transportation. Usually 
        a whole hutong has only one toilet, a building that everyone shares, a 
        place for gossip - the <i>de facto</i> social center of the block (where 
        one can loudly socialize in a squatting position over the sewer trench). 
        There are hutongs and hutongs however; there is a famous shopping hutong 
        and also a pharmacy houtong as well as "finer" hutongs. The number of 
        hutongs is receding though, in the 60's there were as much as 3000 hutongs, 
        now there are only a few hundred left. 
      <p> The old has to be levelled with the ground, in order to make way for 
        the new. No Chinese would ever show any discontent with this, progress 
        is still a good word - and who can blame them? Who would not like running 
        water, sanitary conditions, water closets, power lines that can support 
        more than one 40W bulb per household, telephones, kitchen machinery... 
        We often fret about the loss of our "fine old" workers' quarters here 
        in the West, but who would actually want to live in them? 
      <p> What comes after is not always better though, badly built highrises 
        come by the hundred where the hutongs once stood. The most common building 
        is the 5-6 storey apartment complex, built from the same pre-cast concrete 
        wallframes as the higher houses. Close to the big boulevards are the malls, 
        a relatively new feature in the Chinese city, sporting masses of luxury 
        items that were almost utattainable for most Chinese a few years ago, 
        and, in a way, still are... 
      <p align="left"> <img src="images/017_kina_parkifalsksoldengang.jpg" width="358" height="233"> 
      <p> Chinese shops all look the same, at least if they are on the same street, 
        most often a street can have 3-4 shops (of the same type) that even carry 
        the exact same items. Sometimes there are whole boulevards that have stretches 
        of 10 + similar shops. How do they survive? Why don't they seek a fresh 
        location? I guess that the city was planned that way, the &quot;let's 
        put some hardware stores here&quot; type of thing. Anyway, these stretches 
        of shops make great surreal attractions. 
      <p> Another striking aspect of Chinese city life is that bicycles operate 
        on left-side traffic rules and cars on right-side rules. There are lots 
        of small eateries but these are of little interest to the urban explorer. 
        Beijing used to sport a large amount of lamb-kebab making Iranians, for 
        less than 2 cents a stick you could snack away as much as you wanted. 
        The government, however, decided that the smoke that arose from the snack 
        stalls was a health-hazard, so they banned it. 
      <p> As the kebabs only were available during the evening, I had to look 
        for other types of food on my morning scavenging rounds. I used to start 
        my day taking the 20 minute walk to find the earliest out hotcake vendor 
        on a remote stretch of ring road 4. The hotcake was wrapped around fried 
        bread and a modest fistful of crappy vegetables, but for 20 cents it was 
        an O.K. meal. The seasoned snack-tracker knows that the best food is on 
        the street, fermented in the sun for God-knows-how-many-days and fried 
        at a killer temperature. 
      <p> I never felt threatened during my treks, mostly because I knew that 
        there are few robberies of foreigners in Beijing. I was also careful not 
        to carry too much cash or to have any valuables except for my camera, 
        the Pentax p-30 with the broken trigger that I got for free from a friend 
        back at home. Using a remote trigger-wire I was able to take photos, mostly 
        of different types of streets, shopsigns and weird-looking buildings. 
      <p> <img src="images/017_kina_stadshackinggata.jpg" width="358" height="233">
      <p>Unwashed shitty concrete still make me long for those walks. I like the 
        feeling of doing something almost pointless just for the hell of it. At 
        least walking is better than sitting on one's ass for a whole day doing 
        nothing, perhaps, in the act of walking we can find temporary relief from 
        boredom. Maybe it's not that easy, we're not fleeing from boredom, but 
        seeking out happiness, which according to an age old Powerbase motto "can 
        be bought". 
      <p> One can also "cheat" oneself to happiness, i.e. not spend money for 
        it, thus evading the strict corporate structure of thought that equals 
        happiness with amount spent currency. Happiness is perhaps the Realkapital 
        of Powerbase put into action, walking and pumpin' those endorphins...
