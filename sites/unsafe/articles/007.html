      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Intrigued by the disturbing suburban images of the British prose maverick 
        J G Ballard, you have decided to live out his vision, to immerse yourself 
        in the space of his novels. So you have decided to temporarily reverse 
        your preconceptions, venture forth into the unknown, and enjoy the ride. 
      </p>
      <p> Picture the parking fields sparkling in the sun, the majestic traffic 
        loops enveloping the shopping malls like midgardsormen, the snake in Norse 
        mythology who surrounded the world of men. Around; tall white buildings, 
        competing in height, not industries or factories but Olympian monuments. 
        A water tower just beside them, streamlined and funky, looks more like 
        an alien landing ramp than just another part of the city's plumbing system. 
        Your slick new car purrs on the highway, your window is open and you can 
        smell the intoxicating fragrance of newly laid asphalt as you approach 
        the Dream Factory. </p>
      <p> There, you slide your car into a vacant spot, curiously eyeing the other 
        pilgrims, mostly parents dragging their kids along, bribing them with 
        ice-cream in a funny but necessary ritual of domestication. A thought 
        rushes through your head, &quot;Take off your hat before you go into the 
        church!&quot; and you dismiss it with a smile, your heart warming with 
        sympathy for both children and parents, so oblivious to the comedy and 
        beauty of their game. </p>
      <p> You approach the big slide door, the portal into the Palace of Desire. 
        A smell of the most overwhelming cleanness slips out as you stand in front 
        of the door, marvelling at the smoothness of its motion. The smell drags 
        you inside, it beckons you to get purified. You are in complete &quot;up-time&quot; 
        as you stroll inside, taking in all the impressions without any intellectual 
        interference; pure meditation. </p>
      <p> As you snap out of it, you see a bunch of older kids with rollerblades 
        standing around the ice cream stand in the middle of the shopping centre. 
        Your heart fills with yearning for those days of silent conspiracies. 
        They sneer when you smile at them. Kids are kids. You saunter on to one 
        of the shops. </p>
      <p> Luckily, you didn't bring any money. You haven't planned to buy anything 
        anyway, you're just here for the ride. You engage in conversations with 
        the shop assistants, you help young mothers with their bags, or you watch 
        their kids while they shop. You look at all the stuff and think about 
        what you can buy when you get your next paycheck. You play some obscure 
        arcade games and buy an ice cream (for the change that you happen to have 
        in your pocket.) </p>
      <p> And then evening approaches, gently and slowly. The stream of customers 
        reverses, and then disappears. You are the last one out. At eight o'clock, 
        it is still quite light outside - at least in this northern country - 
        so you take out your camera. Yes. The place is even more beautiful when 
        there are no people there, much more beautiful, in fact. You spend quite 
        some time around the parking lot, and then move on to the factories, shooting 
        some beautiful stills, but soon it is dark and you must retreat. </p>
      <p> You step into the car again, and realize that you need a soft landing 
        from this Ballardland trip, so you head for a gas station and drink a 
        cup of coffee there, absent-mindedly leafing through the magazines. This 
        is a time to digest what has happened today, synthesize, or just forget. 
      </p>
      <p> Don't torture yourself with ashen thoughts of the grim consumer society, 
        the heartless capitalist currents that you fear threaten to sweep away 
        all that used to be human until five minutes ago. You become what you 
        oppose, you know, so today, become it in a different way, immerse yourself 
        in Ballardland, log in to that transcendental feeling of (sub)urban ecstasy 
        - just for a day. Then you can go back to your Marxist critiques of the 
        fragmented post modern society again. In order to understand what you 
        are up against, you must infiltrate it and dig up its very heart, its 
        techniques of seduction. Me? I'm going down to the mall today to rent 
        some movies. </p>
