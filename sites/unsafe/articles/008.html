      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It all began when I bought a Mac Powerbook 190 last year. The Powerbook 
        was equipped with a touchpad, which I thought was kind of neat. A touchpad 
        a great aesthetic solution; a small square under your keyboard, and you 
        don't have to fiddle round with mouse cables anymore. </p>
      <p> However, when I tried to use it, I noticed that it was very difficult. 
        The cursor wouldn't move, or it would move and then go back to where it 
        were when I lifted up my finger. Obviously, it was broken. I went back 
        to the store to complain. There, I was met by disdainful glances and muffled 
        whispers before somebody spoke up: &quot;There's nothing wrong with your 
        touchpad, you just have to practice for a while.&quot; Oh. I marched right 
        back home, ashamed of my lack of dexterity &amp; co-ordination. </p>
      <p> During the following days, since my attempts at direct attack had failed, 
        I tried to outwit my touchpad. &quot;Know thy enemy&quot;. I realized 
        that the pad is sensitive to moist and static electricity. Applying this 
        information, I used pieces of cloth as a buffer between my finger and 
        the pad. It worked perfectly. After having fiddled round for a while with 
        the cloth, I began to get the hang of how to move the cursor to where 
        I wanted, and soon I was even able to discard the cloth. I felt complete 
        again. </p>
      <p> But - and this is the catch - though I can readily control my touchpad 
        most of the time nowadays, I still fail when I'm hurried or nervous. The 
        reason? Sweating from the palms, of course, and God knows what kind of 
        differences in skin electronic potential. And when you're in a hurry, 
        you want things to go fast, right? So you work yourself up even more, 
        and draw your finger along the pad in desperate sweaty trajectories, hoping 
        for the cursor to get going. Resulting, of course, in even more pathological 
        cursory behavior. No, this is not the way to do it, pal. The touchpad 
        is a sophisticated (well, devious, at least) biofeedback device; it must 
        be handled with proper care and respect. </p>
      <p>In the midst of one of these bouts, I suddenly found myself FORCED TO 
        RELAX even though I was seriously stressed out. Just because it seemed 
        to be the fastest way to solve the problem, of course. The nervous system 
        will occasionally do something useful - if it is also a shortcut. I calmed 
        down - started to breathe slowly and deeply - and blanked out inside. 
        When I found out I still had some problems with the pad, I just relaxed 
        even more. Voila. The pad responded 100%. By being sensitive to my level 
        of excitement, it had actually made me go into a state of controlled breathing. 
      </p>
      <p>Now this kind of thing opens up a whole new field of enquiry. I've heard 
        of machines that have useful bugs - but devices that make you meditate 
        AS A SIDE EFFECT? I sense a potential for a whole range of this kind of 
        ZenWare (name deliberately chosen to sound cheesy, of course, and because 
        PranayamaWare is a bit long). Might Powerbase Alpha suggest, for example; 
        <br>
        - a disk drive which is programmed to emit rhythmic, meditative sounds 
        calculated to send you into a trance while you wait for your disk to load; 
        <br>
        - a desktop add-on that replaces all the texts in the alert boxes with 
        koans and paradoxes that twist your brain inside out; </p>
      <p>Inventions like these would either subvert corporate structure from within, 
        or give you peace of mind as a quick &amp; dirty bonus, depending on how 
        you look at it. It's anyone's guess whether they would be manufactured 
        by private persons seeking to sanify the working place or as another zippie 
        toy. </p>
