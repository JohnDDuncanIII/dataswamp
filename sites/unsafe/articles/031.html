      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">&quot;I 
        have always enjoyed walking in towns, well, I don't like crowded places, 
        but more desolate spaces, city space with scarce human population. It 
        feels important to walk around, without a specific goal, and without being 
        overtly anal about seeing *everything*. The act of exploring.&quot; <br>
        <b>Idoren. </b></font></p>
      <p>It's perhaps too easy to see the similarities of this kind of exploration 
        to a general &quot;alternative&quot; outlook on life. We are adrift in 
        a sea of meaninglessness, and this state of things is interrupted only 
        by various emotional experiences that only happen occasionally; when one 
        is reading a book, watching a good film, or meeting someone new and interesting. 
        To not be unhappy, we need our information fix, or go cold turkey. </p>
      <p>The major trick here is to make the mundane interesting. It doesn't *have* 
        to be interesting, it's enough that it seems interesting, and if you're 
        not to queasy, and begin looking under the slacky facade, you can well 
        learn how to pull a trick that was developed by an old-school caste of 
        neuronauts known as the Situationist. They perfected a script, a multithreaded, 
        interactive storyline for instant city exploration. It can turn any city 
        into a place for futant desire, you've just gotta stash up on the right 
        illegal memes needed to turn this activity into a success. </p>
      <p><img src="images/031_2.jpg" width="300" height="112"></p>
      <p>The Situationists referred to pointless city walks as &quot;drifts&quot;. 
        They were obsessed by how maps (like city maps and subway charts) relate 
        to how cities are experienced by human minds. Is it possible to make maps 
        that can convey the experience of the city, in a more straightforward 
        manner than the standard projection logic used by mapmakers? They weren't 
        very successful in creating their maps, although they sure are thinkworthy 
        art objects, they aren't very useful for describing the experience of 
        the &quot;drift&quot;. The situationists knew this for sure - they were 
        trying to keep their knowledge obscure as to keep it from being exploited 
        by the media / spectacle. In some sense that has happened too, situationist 
        lore has been used by the spectacle. Now things have deveoped further: 
        we have the advantage to be able to steal back from the media, to take 
        their advertisement techniques of visualized leisure back to develop a 
        storyboard/filmatic approach for describing various mindframes that the 
        drift can take place in. </p>
      <p><img src="images/031_3.jpg" width="300" height="112"></p>
      <p>The drift is a voyeuristic pleasure trip. Although drifting assaults 
        all one's senses at once, it's foremost a visual reverie. By walking, 
        and being mobile, one reassures an identity as casual observer, not connected 
        to the scenery passing by. This unconnectedness is a source of pleasure. 
      </p>
      <p>The point is to dissociate oneself totally, to observe the surroundings 
        from a detached point of view and laugh at it, or derive pleasure in some 
        other more sinister way. Most accounts about &quot;taoist&quot; or &quot;pantheist&quot; 
        etc thought structures stress the process of &quot;becoming one with nature&quot;, 
        but Powerbase is more concerned with becoming totally disconnected - becoming 
        The Other, relative to the rest of the world. </p>
      <p>The situationist drift is without point, it's more like experiencing 
        the world as a mass of free-floating points, while at the same time experiencing 
        the city as a linear story, a walk that has a beginning and an end. The 
        linear expression comes from the fact that one is walking. The travelling 
        motion through the city is timeless. The space between spaces is emphasized. 
        The experience is also about scrambling, re-coding and de-coding the world 
        into and from different fragments. To be distilled as mindframes, to be 
        used at leisure. </p>
      <p>The situationist drift is without purpose. Even though it at the same 
        time is a quest for pleasure, it's not possible to have that goal active 
        in your mind when you are drifting, because then you will inevitably fall 
        into a state of stressed out oblivion and worry about everything. The 
        trick is to just be happy that you are experiencing something out-of-the 
        ordinary and fulfilling your destiny as mean-assed happy mutant, this 
        way you'll end up in a positive feedback loop of happiness, not too bad 
        for a day walking around aimlessly in the city streets.</p>
