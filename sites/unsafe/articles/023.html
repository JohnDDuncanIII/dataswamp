      <p> In surveilling the endless maze of a modern corporate workforce, the 
        executive in command has quite a few tools in his hand to effectivize 
        and streamline the organization. Spreadsheets are pass&eacute;, today's 
        leader confines in his array of trusty cellular automata powered workforce-honing, 
        efficiency-increasing programs. 
      <p align="left"> The boss hiding behind his big oak desk high up in the 
        skyscraper building is a remnant of the past. Today's exec runs his organization 
        from wherever he happens to be at the moment. Some days he telecommutes 
        from the central station, at other times he simply jumps the nearest bus 
        and does his work from the back seat of bus 23 all day. His freedom of 
        workplace can be credited to his trusty Palm Pilot and cellular phone. 
      <p align="left"><img src="images/023_telefonkiosk.jpg" width="334" height="250"> 
      <p> Bratizlav Mick, that big, red-bearded pirate of a corporate leader spent 
        his prime years running his corporation from a small Zodiac boat somewhere 
        in the Persian Gulf. The threats to his life and the hazards and stress 
        of running his firm soon became too much even for his valiant soul. He 
        decided to hit the road, and take his corporation with him. 
      <p> Every morning at 7, after drinking a sip from the reverse osmosis driven 
        water purifier he downloads today's decision lists and starts his work; 
        at 10AM he starts downloading realtime video feeds from his corp's security 
        camera network, and in the glitches and static interference that plagues 
        the images he thinks he sometimes glimpses God. 
      <p> Rusty Jot, that fat zulu, runs his illegit slave trade by selling off 
        neighbouring tribes (and sometimes when stock is short; his own people). 
        His main customers: multinationals in dire need of cheap labour. He began 
        to doubt that his position at the top was as secure and safe as he had 
        previously thought, and started to plan his technocratical retreat. 
      <p align="left"><img src="images/023_telia.jpg" width="349" height="37">
      <p align="left">The clone arrived late one night; the big slaveship came 
        in to the port and unloaded only one single large crate that was transported 
        by silent eunuchs to the corporate campus, they left the crate to be opened 
        by the boss himself. 
      <p> Later, under the moonless night, a fast trike sped over the dusty roads, 
        towards an eremit's cave somewhere near Lake Tahunta district, a remote 
        part of the land. The only thing that tells the visitor that there's more 
        to the old caveman than what could be expected is the small solar cell 
        recharge unit that is placed outside the cave, but that is only taken 
        as a proof of his eccentricity - could he possibly need it? 
      <p>Late at night, local people say, the cave-eremit is talking to himself 
        in his mad reveries, the talk sounds like business deals are being set, 
        goods are being shipped, slaves are being sold - somewhere in the mad 
        mind of the one that gave up on society such a long time ago.
