<blockquote>

  <p>We were heavily inspired by the works of Jeff Noon when this project started 
    out. At first we wanted to make an hypertext version of a vurt-dream. Then 
    we wanted to make the whole thing more geometrical, so we discarded almost 
    everything of the original idea, keeping only the feather metaphor.</p>
  <p> We think that this metaphor, as presented in the books, is a great analogy 
    for poetry, a poem being somewhat like a dream that lingers a bit after you 
    read it. Dreams are real, even when you dream a lucid dream you feel the reality 
    of it, the core of our essence, what poetry is all about. 
  <p>Life is not really a virtual theatre of postmodern left-brain relativity 
    (even though it may seem so at times). Sure, the menu is not the meal, but 
    the actual process of eating that meal is as real as it gets. Since our history 
    is mostly written by body-punishing French chainsmoking caffeine freaks it 
    tends to omit the reality of life. 
  <p>Logic is a way cool toy but it leads nowhere near any kind of truth. Truths 
    are physical, like someone getting shot in the head; he may or may not believe 
    in the reality of the bullet, yet he is inevitably going to end up dead. Of 
    course truths are not static things (this is why logic fails). 
  <p> What we like to revolt against here is the too-much-theory approach of Western 
    minds towards technology and culture. Even we, on a basic plane, do feel the 
    physicality of being, even though we drink more than 23 cups of coffee a day. 
    The finger to key contact is still aesthetically pleasing for the observer. 
    The physicality of abstract poetry perhaps even more so. 
  <p> Consumer culture and everyday life may seem weird and strange from the viewpoint 
    of the outsider, but J.G. Ballard has channeled his vision of ordinary life 
    wonderfully into his books. By reclaiming social reality from the depths of 
    hive-control, another aesthetic is born. Everything is aesthetic. We aim to 
    please. 
  <p> During the long production stage of this project we have tried different 
    ways of writing hyperlinked poetry. Finally we chose to randomize the links 
    by the use of Javascript. In some poems, all parts are linked to every other 
    part of the document, in other poems the linking is more structured. 
  <p> One of our first ideas was to make the link structure resemble three-dimensional 
    geometric forms, as expressed in the <a href="../tele/1.html">telegraphwires</a> 
    poem. Each paragraph constitutes a "corner" in a virtual box. The telegraphwires 
    poem also features the fuzzy MouseOver interface we intended to use on all 
    the poems. 
  <p> In the <a href="../dada/index.html">DADA</a> poem, which was the next to 
    be completed, we used the zen principle of random links instead - every document 
    is linked to every other document. We also made a starting place that links 
    to all the 100 permutations of the original (which we stole from somewhere). 
  <p>Then we have poems like the <a href="../cube/1.html">hypercube</a>, which 
    is an attempt at explaining 4-dimensionality in a poetic right-brain way. 
    We suggest that you try to keep a fast pace as you explore the poems, focusing 
    more on the n-dimensional movement of the globe and let the texts be secondary. 
  <p><a href="../love/1.html">Vurtlove</a>, then, is an expos&eacute; of the forces 
    of love. Insane, strictly geometrical, and yet so terribly pure. &quot;Poised 
    on the verge of explicit expression&quot; as someone has put it. 
  <p>Think of an army of neonate robots coming of age in a post-industrial environment, 
    and you've got <a href="../smile/1.html" target="">The Wild Bots</a>. 
  <p>The <a href="../pent/1.html" target="">Archipelago</a> - the Milky Way mist 
    seeps into the very soul of the island folk. Beauty can be found in the mixture 
    of seagull cries and lonely heavy metal riffs echoing over the silent water.
  <p>Life goes on, despite totalitarian intervention, on the edge of the <a href="../shang/1.html" target="">Old 
    Ring Road</a>.
  <p> This site is also an attempt to explore the geometry of hyperlinking. As 
    HTML architects, we build a structure where before was none. Normally the 
    geometry of virtual places is incorporated within the architecture. We try 
    to show "wireframes" of the poemic structure (except for the dada poem which 
    is pure void). 
  <p> The process of mapping space is reality creation; it literally creates space. 
    Raw space is frightening. The creative artist is creating culture by wiring 
    the virtual fences on the spaceless plain of virtuality and in this way creating 
    the founding polygons of culture. 
  <p>This site <i>relies</i> on Javascript, so you better surf with a browser 
    version 3 or better. Also you need a color or gray-scale screen to see the 
    graphix, which are an essential part of the poems.
