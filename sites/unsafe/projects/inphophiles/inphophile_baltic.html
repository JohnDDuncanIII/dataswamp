              <p>- from the fictional Northern Lights Issue of Powerbase Alpha. 
              <p align="center"><img src="baltic_boat.jpg" width="400" height="111"> 
              <p>Going by ferry across the Baltic Sea is the default mode of travelling 
        between Finland and Sweden. The traffic is quite heavy, with several departures 
        a day and a plaethora of obscure shipping lines to choose from. Towering 
        above the competition are the mammoth companies Silja and Viking. Like 
        some mythological twin brothers, they are eternally locked in a battle 
        for absolute power and domination. 
      <p>The Silja line of ships differs in subtle ways from the Viking line. 
        Silja employs some kind of musical trench warfare, different tunes streaming 
        from unseen speakers everywhere, tailor-made location-specific muzak, 
        optimized for working on subliminal levels. 
      <p>As a journalist trying to sample the quaintness of the Norse travellers' 
        minds that frequent these boats, let me start out with a short description 
        of the usual cast of characters that haunt the mighty vessels on the Baltic 
        Sea. 
      <p>- The first, most ubiquitous group is the mass of faceless travellers 
        that appear so generic that they practically belong to the interior. 
      <p>- The second group [class] are the dead-drunk salarymen that try to score 
        with baroquely made-up Russian 30-somethings that wobble around the disco 
        and nightclub floors. 
      <p>- The most visible group of them all are the party people, who travel 
        the boats under the delusion that it is a classy way to spend a weekend. 
        These people believe that human suffering would end with the abolition 
        of tax on alcohol, cigarettes and petrol. 
      <p>- Another group are the gypsies that keep court in one of the public 
        spaces or under a large staircase. With their staccato language and their 
        total disregard for ordinary, normal, society they constitute a vital 
        ingredient in the funky, multicultural melting pot that is assembled beneath 
        the wings of the mighty tycoons that govern these transit operations. 
      <p>[another distinct caste are the innocent bystanders; people who has to 
        travel the boat to get to the other shore, and who isn't into boating 
        for the experience of the ride itself - all other parties are interested 
        in the travel, this group would abolish travel if they could as it is 
        a waste of time, money and sanity]

                <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the 
                main street with lightshow (that is always on)</font> 
              <p>The boats offer interesting vistas for the journalists, the spectacle-hungry 
        people of all ages that travel the boats for the quaint atmosphere. The 
        boat on the picture above has a big aisle - a city-like street that is 
        the heart of the boat. It has its own little cafeterias and shops just 
        like a *real* city, only it is just make-believe. The designer of this 
        boat apparently ripped the design right out of Logan's Run - a simulation 
        of a Mega-City beneath a canopy of shielding plastic. There's an array 
        of disco spots projecting gaily colored lights and moving images onto 
        the white plastic surface of the fake houses along the main street. What 
        masterful cybernetic system runs this impeccable operation? 
      <p>The boats are mediated, and virtual conflicts of a virtual crew are taken 
        to heart of millions of boob tube addicts in both Sweden and Finland. 
        The show is called Rederiet. 
      <p align="center"><img src="baltic_view.jpg" width="309" height="207"><br>
                <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">plastic 
                windows look down on a fake world</font> 
              <p> <i>Back to the real-time boating experience, ruminations after an intense 
        shopping experience...</i> Browsing the tax-free store, I could find *nothing* 
        I wanted. Don't get me wrong here, I'm a cigarettes and whiskey man, but 
        all these bottles and boxes of cigarettes were so close to pure simulacra. 
        The people with bulging eyes in their virtual paradise, where there is 
        no tax on their favorite drugs and high caloric foods. I consider myself 
        a chocolate freak, but I can find no respite in buying a 1 kilo box of 
        Snickers. 
      <p>Sounds of jolly string orchestras infest the airspace and sweeps the 
        store in an airconditioned mist of cheap unreality. To add to that effect 
        a pagan march is on it's way on main street, the big fake road, little 
        children on a hollow crusade. Dressed to impress the most hardened pedophile, 
        charming little hats and elven dresses, side by side, on a line, workin' 
        the street. The parade starts beneath the casino in the stern of the boat 
        and ends at the aft, in front of &quot;Joe's bar&quot;. Some children 
        are dressed up as mythical figures, some as firemen, or police. What is 
        the purpouse of this ritual? Why is it repeated several times, during 
        every voyage? Is it to ensure the boat arrives safely? Is it a token of 
        worship of the sea-gods? On main street the marvel is pipers, playing 
        jolly songs [of days long gone] from the nooks and crannies in the plastic 
        housing. Not only the children dress up on Silja Line; as soon as the 
        boat is good away from the port, old and young show up on main street 
        dressed in fine clothes, window-shopping (like fine folx used to do on 
        Sundays). This is an orderly, well rehearsed and important ritual for 
        the bourgeoise, where they pretend to live in civilized abolition, but 
        when they are really burning for the hour the tax-free store open it's 
        pearly gates.

              <p>As I had been wandering around the tax-free store for a good twenty minutes 
        I saw something that froze my heart, I didn't know whether to freak out 
        or just gawk at the spectacle that was taking place in front of my eyes. 
        A fully-dressed, card carrying member of the Clowns guild was putting 
        on a little show in front of the Tequila-shelf. Jokingly he worked hard 
        to convince the shoppers to try on a new blend of booze. Alcohol is such 
        a uniting factor in the world. People might be strange &quot;over there&quot; 
        but, hey, they are just like us, they take the same drugs.
