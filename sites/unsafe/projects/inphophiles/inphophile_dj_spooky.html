              <p><i>DJ Spooky buzzword of the day:</i> 
                <script language="">
document.write ( (blurbfly[VonStroheim(blurbfly.length)]) + ".")
</script>
              
              <p>Powerbase Alpha's Info Retrieval Squad managed to get a few words 
                with afro-futurist extraordinaire DJ Spooky at his rare Sweden 
                appearance in Gothenburg, October 1999. 
              <p>Spooky writes for Paper, Art Byte and other mags, and DJ:s in 
                New York. His name is associated with the illbient scene that 
                was written up in hip music magazines a couple of years back. 
                He has a forthcoming science fiction novel, <i>And now a message 
                from our sponsors</i>, and a novel dealing with intellectual property 
                called <i>Flow my blood the DJ said</i>. 
              <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I like 
        to use this parallel to tags in the New York subway system when talking 
        about DJing. They used to go for bombing whole trains so the trains would 
        carry their mark back and forth through the city. The goal was to get 
        &quot;all city&quot; so your tags could be seen all over New York. It 
        was a way of bypassing the official structure and a fight over social 
        space. DJing is kinda like that, sending music through the system. And 
        DJing is also a conceptual art form - a Gesamtkunstwerk. Records are the 
        &quot;found objects&quot; in a fragmented society, used in a collage form. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">We're 
        sort of like the first generation to be completely saturated with media. 
        Culture has become a worldwide phenomenon. We've gotten to the point where 
        you could send something around the world and people around the world 
        would react in virtually the same way. DJ culture is a progenitor of global 
        culture. It bypasses the normal means of distribution of music and crosses 
        boundaries. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">The last 
        ecological remix was the death of the dinosaurs. In the 21st century we 
        may have to face the consequenses of rampant consumerism. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I act 
        as a cipher translating between forms of culture. I traveled a lot when 
        I was a kid, maybe that's why I can deal with moving between different 
        situations. I try to make bridges between different scenes, I have no 
        problem dealing with both academic culture and pop culture. I feel fluid. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">My conceptual 
        framework for &quot;Riddim Warfare&quot; was &quot;war against the one 
        track mind&quot;. That was the general idea with the artwork and the music. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I don't 
        sympathize with the strict avant-garde scene. In Europe you have more 
        of patronage system, where the state finances academic music and there 
        are all these academic festivals you can keep going on. There, you can 
        sell 200 records and still be considered an important artist and never 
        have to relate to pop culture. In the US there's no infrastructure for 
        avant garde. You have to become your own patron. I do like the music, 
        though, like David Shea and John Zorn and all the Knitting factory stuff. 
        But they don't really deal with pop culture, and I think that's a problem. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">Hip hop 
        is almost the perfect capitalist culture. It's all about fancy cars and 
        money and stuff. But the thing is, capitalism is driven by finding new 
        markets, finding new ideas and selling them, which makes hip hop a very 
        dynamic culture at the same time. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">The 
        idea behind afro-futurism was to create a symposium of post-modern, or 
        electro-modern (as I like to say) discussion where you don't really know 
        who's who. Internet opens up a flow of ideas. Ethnicity and identity in 
        general is left in doubt. The uncertainty left people feeling very strange. 
        Someone would be considered a great authority on African American subjects 
        by a lot of black people on the list, while in reality he was white. Everyone 
        would assume someone named Goldberg to be a Jew, but he was in fact black, 
        and so on. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">African 
        American culture is the first really post-modern culture. You have to 
        remember that everything, religions, communities and languages were erased. 
        Jews and other nomadic cultures in similar situations stress the importance 
        of holding on to traditions. For blacks in America today, hip hop is that 
        kind of thing. At the same time, hip hop can absorb anything from the 
        outside, incorporating it into its framework. It's a bit like American 
        culture, which is mostly the same thing. Black American culture is like 
        the official culture of the US. When people think about the US, both in 
        the US and in other parts of the world, they think about African American 
        culture. White people in New York dress just like black kids in the hood. 
        This is because of its fluid nature, I believe. There is always something 
        in flux. And American culture is like that too. The US has no central 
        culture, it just sucks everything in and then spits it out. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I hadn't 
        read Kodwo Eshun's book when I recorded <i>Riddim Warfare</i>. When I 
        read it, first I was pissed that he didn't put me in the book [<i>More 
        Brilliant than the Sun</i>]. Then I was amazed how he wrote a book that 
        exactly parallelled the ideas on my record. That kind of thing happens 
        to me all the time now. I get a thought and a couple of months later I 
        read about it in some magazine. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I think 
        the most homogenous cultures, those that have been isolated from the rest 
        of the world in some way, are the most friendly import nations of the 
        world. Japan is a good example of that. These countries are really hungry 
        for outside information. 
      <p><img src="space_invaders2.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">I think 
        Mediterranean culture during Rome was the first real mix-culture, with 
        art and culture moving back and forth over vast areas. The US is kinda 
        like an accelerated Rome. 
              <p><img src="space_invaders.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="3">Some 
                of the kids are more interested in the theory than my actual music. 
                I think that's ok. It's great if I can get people interested in 
                that kind of thing, you know?
