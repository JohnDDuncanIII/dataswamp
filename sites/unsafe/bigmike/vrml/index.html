  <h1>Viridian Principles in VRML (version 2.0).</h1>
  <p><b>Attention Conservaton notice</b>: This is an experimental VRML presentation 
    of the Viridian Principles as in <a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/%7Emitch/V-Notes/ViridianNote00003.html">Viridian 
    Note 00003</a>. It's nothing more than typography in three dimensions - on 
    a green background. You need a VRML plugin to view it or you'll only see the 
    preview images.</p>
  <p><b>UPDATED AND REVISED!</b> Thanks to kind advise from fellow Viridian <a href="http://www.karmanaut.com">Viveka 
    Weiley</a> the VRML browser now defaults to spin controls, making the site 
    a lot more user-friendly and smooth.</p>

  <p><b>Introduction:</b> I never got the viridian principles the first time I 
    read them, so I decided to go back and work with them a little to see if I 
    could get a better hold of them. First I thought of making a Calderesque mobile 
    where different parts could be inscribed with the data of the principes (as 
    a standard website using DHTML). Instead I chose to make something more like 
    the <a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com">Visual Thesaurus</a>: the principles 
    are presented as ASCII text floating in different directions in 3-d space. 
    You are now able to rotate and read the text from different angels, and perhaps, 
    get a graphical image, a structure of how the different principles correspond. 
    It could, of course, have been more visually engaging if the principles had 
    been engraved on 3-d models of geometrically interesting bacteria, plancton, 
    or the cilia of Big Mike. The file size of such projects would soon rise to 
    absurd dimensions (at least for todays internet conditions). Instead I opted 
    to make the site as small and minimalistic as possible: the average file size 
    in this VRML presentation is 4k. The VRML presentation totals at 91k, making 
    the download of the actual site fast (the plugin is still a stiff 3.1M).</p>

  <p><b>Instructions:</b> To view this site you need a VRML 2.0 plugin such as 
    the <a href="http://www.cosmosoftware.com/download/">Cosmo player (official 
    site)</a>. If the official site is down (happens a lot) use Vivekas <a href="http://www.karmanaut.com/cosmo/player/">mirror 
    site</a>. Tip to Mac users: increase your Netscape memory allocation to 60Mb 
    when you use the plugin. More resources <a href="http://www.vrml.org/fs_resources.htm">here</a>.
