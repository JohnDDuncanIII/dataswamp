Based on a <a href="http://burn.ucsd.edu/paris8.htm">poster</a> from the May 68 
revolution (which in turn is based on a work from some finnish guy from the 1890s), 
and a popular matchbox design. The bland colors speak of ghastly death, dust and 
dirt. Crude hand-tooled look for traditional propaganda feel (to make the message 
seem more important than the poster design, and to make it more visually accessible 
to old folks). The downside of the design is that it looks like a poster for an 
old Sci-Fi movie (would it be taken seriously or are they running reruns of an 
obscure 50's film in the neighbourhood movie theatre?). It also looks like commie 
propaganda which might dishearten american onlookers (perhaps better suited for 
European, South American, Asian etc. usage).
