<blockquote>
  <p>The base of the Viridian teakettle looks like a slab of dark coral stone 
    but is in fact the machinery of the kettle that brews the tea. To brew a cup 
    of tea, one fills one of the detachable mugs or jugs that come with the machine 
    with fresh water and place it on the slab. How the water is then drained through 
    the bottom of the jug is a mystery that we needn't dwell too much upon, it 
    just happens, probably through some kind of chemosmosis. Once in the slab, 
    the water molecules are heated by the complex molecular machineries of a clan 
    of thermophiles (bacteria that thrive on heat) that lives in the agar-lined 
    caverns inside. When the tea is ready it's filtered back to the waiting cup. 
    The tightly held cup is now released and the human operator can have his treat 
    as well as the bacteria that get to feast on the waste tea leaves and store 
    up on energy for the next batch. The process isn't completely self-contained 
    and needs some external energy source as well as an occasional sugar water 
    or papier mach&eacute; run to revitalize the system.</p>
