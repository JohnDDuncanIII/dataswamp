<p>
Phase 1: 1939 - Berlin: Rhizomaniacs decouple Tank War Europa from its simulation in the underground beer halls of emasculated Weimar democracy, plugging the deleometers of total mobilization into a megamachine of mass death.  1946 - French Indo-China: it washes ashore in the oil slick geo-strategy of ethnic cleansing in three movements: 
<br>1). establish a system of strong points (microfascisms) 
<br>2). spread 'pacification' forces out into a gridwork of small territorial boxes 3). comb each square, from periphery to core, with the aim of netting insurgent forces at close quarters and drawing them into prepared killing zones.  
Space invaders strung out across the rice paddies, occupying space in encirclement and supression campaigns - geo-eugenic anti-infestation measures: flea control.  As the slick advances, the front disperses; converting vast expanses of territory into expanding periphery always already infested with insectoid guerrillas, broadening the insurgent target area.  On the strategic defensive in phase 1, 

<p>"analogically, the guerrilla fights the war of the flea, and his military enemy suffers the dog's disadvantages: too much to defend, too small, ubiquitous, and agile an enemy to come to grips with.  If the war continues long enough, the dog succumbs to exhaustion and anaemia without ever having found anything on which to close its jaws or to rake with its claws." (Robert Taber, 'The War Of The Flea")  
 Anexact but rigourous aims of guerrilla fighters: attack to defend, alternated with long periods of catatonic inactivity; procure weapons; capture ammunition; kill; kill time; force the enemy to overextend lines; pick off small units; secrete terror; "select the tactics of seeming to come from the East and attacking from the West; avoid the solid, attack the hollow; attack; withdraw; deliver a lightning blow, seek a lightning decision" (Mao) in the five-minute assault.<p>
Phase 2: Dogboys assembled in Chopper War U.S.A., gameboy faces, dromocratic technical-transport bodies of amphibious warfare, kill by strapping on the supple metallic microhead and diverting selection into the scansion of the central computing eye - scanning all the radii of isotopic space through the visor of the helicopter pilot's helmet, deleometers gridding tele-space interfaced at a distance in the target selector - sharpening hyperleptic reflexes on audio-visual slaughter consoles.  Projecting itself quickly, but 
lacking the impercep-tible speeds of insurgency, the whole campaign falls back on Tank War Europa, the Euclidean geometry of military space cross-hatching the central lowlands of the geo-political core, North to South, from the bunkers of suburban Berlin to the Siegfried Line, passing through the Maginot Line and the Atlantic Wall: trans-European odyssey telescoped into the abbatoirs of a common, selective slaughter policy - mobile meat cull finally allowing the State's death machines to leave the rails in the delirium of all-out suicide.  End gaming sequence 1964: Chopper War U.S.A. falters at Ben Tre, on the Mekong Delta: "We had to destroy the town in order to save it" - green and fertile paddies and jungle denuded with Agent Orange, napalm, white phosphorous; 
 colouring smooth space with the alien pixellated lines of a digital wargame.Phase 2 levels the scores.  Gridlock.  Dynamic equilibrium of forces unable to exterminate each other.  In the intervals between strikes, insurgent forces create freezones on the edge of No Man's land: black economies making inroads into the white economy of the invading forces.  Constant division of guerrilla forces into smaller units (1000s to 100s to 10s) - into n-1 units of the numbering number, diffused across an alloplastic vectorial field, looming in the faceless horror of
omnipresence, infusing softening syndromes into the brain core of madrepoid space invader intelligence.  Geo-strategic command squanders its logistical capital in launching search and destroy missions against a single, unified mega-unit that does not exist.  Occupation of the South Vietnam fields is metricized in terms of the haemorrhage of the economy in massive Kapital bleed-out, speeding up to $3,000,000 per hour.
<p>Axiom 2: Control of time smoothes out space into a vectorial multiplicity propagating revolutionary forces towards Nu-Earth.
<p>Phase 3: Radical asymmetry between guerrilla swarm and State army - mere survival as involutionary victory versus the deathtrip equalization of standing force, converging on the annihilation of enemies in open, agonistic combat.  Contracted, legal war, governed by international statutes and rules, spills over into escalating genocide as the invading State aim becomes untenable.  "Hold space" melts into the relentless instruction sequencing special forces operations: "Kill kill kill!"  Central authority divides into three zones:<p> 1). Zone of power - organic stratometers governing isometric command chains between State and army; 
 <br>2). Zone of indiscernibility - segmentometers relating to the diffusion of these chains through a microphysical fabric in optic space; <br>3). Zone of impotence - deleometers relating to the insurrectionary flow of mobilization the State converts and diverts without being able to control and define.  <p>For guerrilla forces, this third zone unleashes the lines of flight necessary for dispersal in No Man's land, yielding control of the ambient, haptic, paranoid time-space of assassination which overturns central intelligence's notions of where revolutionary desiring machines are going to hit next.  War on n fronts which the State cannot win, short of thermonuclear obliteration.  Multitudes of imperceptible du-kich fighters swarm in haptic space, touching from too close to be destroyed, neutralizing the logistical supremacy of space invaders.  Fourth dimension intrusion which "reduces central power to the level of a helpless, sprawling octopus.  During the hours of day sporadic rioting takes place and massive sniping.  Night brings all-out warfare, organized fighting, and unlimited terror. . ." (Black Nationalist Revolutionary Action Movement - position paper, 1961: Taber, p.145)  Chopper War U.S.A. follows the deleometric line into abolition in the white hot intoxication of mechanized assault, dispatching patrols into the jungle safe zones of the N.V.A. swarms, gridding space with fire lanes (segmentometers), which break all bonds with the optic stratometers of slick conquest as they are swallowed by haptic space.  Mobile rapid response units of space invaders are reterritorialized on the static black hole system of fire bases - waiting in the dark to be picked-off, limb, by limb, by limb; paralyzed in the suburbs of Necropolis: the neutralizing space in which the loss of movement for invaders 
 means prolonged exposure to the jungle, infection, death.<p>
Flashback 1945: Telegram 71 exhibits fascism at its apogetic point-instant as the despotic stratifier severs its head from the filth of the unworthy mass body in the ruins of Tank War Europa: as the Russian tanks close in, Hitler's last order from the bunker decrees the total annihilation of Berlin.  Time up.  Game over.  "We had to destroy the town in order to save it."<p>
Phase 4:Rewind.  Dromoscopic Vietnam restarted by the film companies.  Biomorphic horror rides solarized atrocity newsreels into the D.M.Z. of the arcade; fusing brain core, nerve cortex, and movement-image on the glutinous screen of the console.  Video captured in the Persian Gulf, virtual war slams airborne cyber-deleonomes against an immobilized, sedentary enemy in U.N. tele-spatial media mash-up.  Desert storm operators rewind resonating variations of the same captured events in playstation slick war space; loops of Tank War Europa shots, beneath Panavia fighter planes in smooth blue stratospheric kill zones; sampled shots of helicopter wreckage as foci of maximum arousal in adolescent sex substitutes.
The speed of an accelerated lifespan, measured at a couple of (million) dollars per multiple tactical experiment on line.  This time Chopper War U.S.A. is a success.  But still the oil slick burns in the Gulf, spilling out petrochemical jihad.  Thousands of dead black birds.  Feed forward to European Unification model 2, great intercontinental meat market population regulator: "We had to destroy the herd in order to save it."  Guarantor of Western democracy, and another pitiful, moralistic rant-block for the socialist elite.  In the arcades, virtual war datableeds out of telecommercialcorporate control, 
 
 washing amphibious pioneers of the end of the State onto the fractal subdivisions of coastlines of imperial glacis; smearing zones of indiscernibility into the transversal propagation media of insurgent forces - crawling out of a glutinous, liquid, inhuman deterritorium aligned on the future: sharpening hyperleptic reflexes on audio-visual slaughter consoles . . . . .

T1:Brain Core Crystal Company trading posts occupy Terra Nova, capturing the future in long wave, resonating Kondratieff cycles; katagenic dialectics of decline and renewal, falling back on the productive forces all the better to demonstrate a universal tendency for the reproduction of bourgeois surplus value.  Already waging guerrilla war in the future, peripheral K-class Kommunism vibrates fibrous tentacles, as cones of attraction to the dark side, by means of a swarmachinic remix of the Marxian Critique of Political Economy; purpose unknown, effectuated as emergent havoc, rather than historical destiny, under three propositions:
<p>1)The universal propensity to extract reproducible bourgeois/human surplus value is analytically inextricable from seething allopoietic vivisystems.
<br>2)Transhumant markets, autochthonic desiring machines, and voodoo futures 
 trading are all alloplastic vectors ungoverning the infrastructure.
<br>3)Katagenic desolation of the superstructure is immanent to the programming of production.
<p>
Short of theology and fascism, brain core capitalism is already virtually extinct.  Crippled Archangel of Meat Cull Europa withers into grey dust on Terra Nova.  Insect swarms arrive like fate - nth dimension intrusion across the spinal thresholds of the socius - passing memeplexed revolution sequences through the germ plasm of evolutionary vehicles.  Becoming metallic.  Becoming swarm.  Unnatural participation as elan vital  bootstrapping imperceptible colonization of Nu-Earth into virtual operativity.
<p>
T2:Celibate machines reproduce human surplus value, furnishing the bourgeoisie with recording rights to all of capitalism's operative axioms, bringing organic stratometers, judgments of God governing isometric command chains, crushing down on schizonomadic economic swarm space.  Diffused through the microphysical weave of spinal multiplicity, metrophage control command sequences institute the bourgeoisie as the optimal distribution profile for State power.  No more dysfunctional despotic masters: slaves command other slaves in the ravenous stomach of the crystal factory complex - the mutant, urogenital servomechanism calibrated for the reproduction of the capitalist socius in the gambling dens of Terra Nova markets.
<p>
White terror.  The whites are landing - taking islands in Africa in the dromocratic rush of the megamachine of amphibious colonization - we shall have to submit to 
 baptism, put on clothes, and work.  The proletariat is exhumed as the worker-soldier automaton, a spectacular species of drone collapsing into atrocity in the optic space managed by the bourgeoisie. A multitude of black bodies, soulless and bent on destruction, domesticated galleries of inorganic menace, crystal heaps of virtual anti-organic force stretched out over Kapital disequilibrium degree xero(x).  Builders of cities.  Professional killers.  Synergists of First World Security.
<p>
Compressed between spinal levels of brain core strata, the proletariat is smeared into indiscernibility: datableed seeping out towards expanding periphery as metrophage institutes its target fronts.  Oil slick endocolonization mobilizes in two waves:
<p>1)Meat Cull Europa: distributing geo-eugenic single currencies across the ecu-menon, numbering populations as zombies, shunted into the carceral warrens of a Trans-European concentration camp.  Phnom Penh year zero: everything entered on the slate is hereby null and void in the axiom laboratories of the suicidal State, gridding tele-space down gun-sights in the royal science of deleometry, attacking the populations swarming across its skin like a rabid dog.  In the Surgical Experiment Department of the Institue for Hygiene and Scientific Research, whiteman macroface vivisects swarm microhead - a miracle of modern science - and then watches it die.  Farmed-out as prime E.U. girlflesh in the Joy Division, Daniella Preleshnik, stripped of arborified extensity, becomes a number - an insect; bug-hunted out of existence. Ka-Tzetnik 135633.
<p>
		
 "Through the wire screen, the faces of those standing outside looked at her as into the cage of some rare exotic creature in a zoo.  She was lying naked, her  parted knees still strapped to the iron rods at both sides of the table.  And in the hands of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument which they had that morning inserted deep into her body.  She shuddered instinctively. She wanted to scream, but, as in a dream, the screams stuck in her throat.  Her strapped life writhed within her."
(Ka-Tzetnik 135633:"House Of Dolls")
<p>
Walk backwards.  Say nothing.  You're being probed for Terra Nova extermination: as Cambodia burns, only two battalions of Khmer Rouge infantry remain in the petrified city.
<p>
2)Atroci-T.V.:Intersected at Zapruder frame 313, the President's head explodes.  Brain core splatters into ARPANet.  Rhizomaniac Stealth Agencies monitor the accumulation of virtual assassination weapons, becoming insect to graduate miniaturized search and destroy missions, targetting unspecified enemy hives in the future.  Special Weapons and Tactics are sequenced as SWAT, encrypting simulated World War 3 outcomes on black ice.  Celibate machines rewind hypertelic memory through the crystal world of event strikes, global peace, deterrence.  Calculated rhythms of airborne atrocity converge in montages of optimal disaster management: causing events in the future not to happen, even though they have already taken place - retrieved and reiterated in resonating tele-space.

<p>Walk backwards.  Say nothing.  History runs backwards, from Terra Nova; 
 coursing in reverse down the inclined plane of purposive human teleology onto the inert vertebral surface of the perpetual present.  K-class vivisystems seep into imperceptibility: constantly interrogated as the silent majorities, the masses implode into an amorphous statistical aggregate - a number-crunched black hole engulfing the social in static repetition of the same feedback loops.  Unstemmable datableed, pauperizing the capitalist State.  Arborified reprocessing of destitution - taking islands in Africa to distribute collective guilt, smeared across social democratic management of scorched urban flashpoints - racist endo-colonization - cannibalizing the techno-kinetic fourth world of ghetto architectures into a beleaguered stratum: ripe for catastrophe management.
<p>
Time music creeps across spinal landscapes, marking-off no-go zones on Nu-Earth.
<p>
T3:Red terror.  The capitalist state squirms in the shadow of the propagating minorities.  Surging up through history, the war of the flea marshals the power of a nondenumerable, infinite set: a Kommunist swarmachine running numbering numbers across haptic space, assembling shock regiments, passing through n dimensions of imperceptibility, targetting the Hellbound bulk of dogman brain core.  Eyes crystals sunk in offal - blacked-out in visions of China.  Red Army as demonic alliance, counted-out in n-1 units of faceless multiplicity; acentred and always hiving off into smaller units, beggaring imagination in the nebulous appearance of omnipresence.
<p>

 Flashback 1949: strung out on the Long March, Mao captures the swarmachine on the resonating recording surface of neo-despotism after internal nomadism threatens to flip the socialist State into an ungovernable colony of imperceptible numbering numbers: proletarian schizo microhead, propagating minorities through hive contagion.  Surplus value=inextricable.  The socialist State confronts the same limits as its capitalist competitors in trafficking optimal crisis management scenarios: virtual extinction, depreciation of existing capital, peripheral datableed destroying majority as axiom - replicating what the captured global war machine sets out to exterminate.  Every massacre rallies a minority of the dead minority - numbered legions of the living dead swarming towards the hive colony of Nu-Earth.
<p>
Crisis management of the swarmachine - internal disjunction managed by the Party apparatus goes rhizomaniac in the constant adjustment of population to the target rates of the planned economy, and the correct line of Marxism-Leninism as interpreted by the Central Brain Core of the People's Republic.  The Chairman's voice speeds up into an insect buzz as he speaks:
<p>
"Every year our country draws up an economic plan in order to establish a proper ratiobetween accumulation and consumption and achieve an equilibrium betweeen production and needs.  Equilibrium is nothing but a temporary, relative unity of opposites.  By the end of the year, this equilibrium, taken as a whole, is upset by the struggle of opposites; the unity undergoes a change, equilibrium becomes disequilibrium, unity becomes disunity, and once again it is 
 necessary to work out an equilibrium and unity for the next year.  Herein lies the superiority of our planned economy." 	
(Mao Tse-Tung,"On The Correct Handling of Contradiction...")
<p>
Categorical imperative: "Act as if there were no tomorrow."  Collapse into the future, occupying the sink holes taking commerce down into exchange rate mechanisms that clear all markets in all future states of the economy. A miracle managed by the guns of the military command core - invasion fleets poised off the coastlines of the black future - taking islands in Africa; washing red flags in the boiling Atlantic.  Here we are stranded.  but we'll find new accomodation, we'll make plans for mobile homes.  Welcome to the Strife Kolony.  Still life in mobile homes.  Memory as fluid duration distributed across C.N.S. segmented worm and fibrous nerve cortex, reassembled in Red Army hive mind and crashed in Kommunist Pioneer year zero aphasia.  Moon over China.  Stir of light through dark shoals on jungle river beds.  Tiles on graves and rotting temples.  Blacked out....

T4:At the end of the river, the special forces are dashed on the reef of the faceless horror of an inorganic Kolony populated by insect Kommunists.  Kommunists like us.  Multitudes of imperceptible du-kich guerrillas swarm in haptic space, too close to be wiped out - even though targetted in infra-red and heat-sensitive sniperscopes, magnifying starlight to pixellate concealed enemies; mobile radar units; biologicals; cluster bombs; smart bombs; smart video war - more dangerous than the regular chu-luc troops of the Red Army because cut across by a machinic phylum figuring multiform 
 units in time-space. Crystal Company SWAT operations fail in K-class no-go zones: missions dispatched to follow individual units back to the megahive are picked off by snipers in the jungle.  Swarmachines are virtual entities - hive multiplicities swamping organic, central control in emergent revolutionary assemblages; pack becomings rushing across the Body without Organs, propagated by epidemic.  Express n dimensions of intensive differentiation by running the swarmachine sequence itself, shifting phase into the actual.  By which time it's all over for Metrophage....
<p>
Spinal landscape intersected at T4 dissolves in asymmetry.  Snowballing nth dimension intrusion unleashes partisans of World War 4: autosatanic transformers as a swirl of metal flies, pulsing in contagious heaps as they spill out of evolutionary classification, crawling through cosmic continua.  Involution through various becomings animal, vegetable, mineral, bacteria, virus, molecule, wavelength pulses digital voodoo codes into the target selectors of metallic probe heads.  Allopoietic black magic - infusorian Kommunism - sorceror's diagrams sprayed on the white walls: diagonal arrows routing instructions for anti-strata spill-out.   Proper names.  Numbering numbers. Borderlines of gangsta colonies, fracturing into smaller units as the social fabric rots - segments shifting co-ordinate points and dislocating, smearing macroface.  KOOL KILLER 666.
<p>
After all the fasciculated bundles of intensity available to the bourgoisie have been gathered on the battlefields of crystal space, there are only minutes to go to Terra Nova phase shift into superstructural extermination as the peripheral vortex 
 heats up.  Chaos theory as a wave of arson in a climate of revolutionary emergency: "A single spark can light a prairie fire." (Mao]   War in the suburbs of Hell.

Eugenic galleries of bourgeois facial patter recognition burn.  Decalcomania.  Permanent material damage.  Organic security melting away in the assassination fugues of derailed fear.

 <h2>NEO-FUTURISM</h2>

(0) Beyond the authoritarian mania of modernist econometric planning, and the nihilistic,  self-referential third cycle damnation of the ultramodern NOW, NEO-FUTURISM tracks a double process: - (i) where the operational political, economic, and sociological codes of universalized humanity contract - to the point where, condemned to endlessly circulate in an interminable statistical survey, they finally collapse into a black hole where meaningless signs reduplicate themselves. This is the secondary process. The humanities in flames. (ii) The primary process: where the abstract, generic value of human intelligence migrates beyond the madreporic core of an organism regulated by the negative feedback of theses archaic codes - becoming increasingly artificial and synthetic at intense speeds, converging on a future in which it has already been rewired. Here the "medium is the message": a viral mechanism acclerating the replication of more of itself. Runaway capitalism; anarchic, "headless" self-organization. Invasion from the future.
<p>
(0.1) The secondary process, humanism as such, issues from the cold ecstasy of the space-mind: the spatializing consciousness which segments and codifies the economic circulation of markets, linguistic signs, and libidinal capital into an organic unity - under the structural law of value. Equilibrium is maintained under the principle of commutability in the exchange of equivalents. It maps the totality of conditions for experience by asking (i) what is it? (ii) where does it come from? (iii) what does it mean? It evokes undead archaisms, which float suspended in cold limbo - power, the social, meaning: it's all
 
 over, but it continues to haunt all the metrics covering segmented space - so many ghosts in the rear-view mirror. These codes constitute a stratified death sentence - effectuating all conditions of possibility, legislating by means of semiotic constants, dividing all virtual forms into actual systems of binary opposites, powered by negative feedback, issuing the judgement which allows the only possible metamorphosis: life passes into death, corporeality into incorporeality, being into nonbeing. It lives in the past. In dead space. Dead time. Hard outlines only secreted in death. Static, cold extermination; secured at the moment of its deconstruction.
<p>
(0.2) NEO-FUTURISM experiences this sinister verdict as an admonition to flee. It is our passeism. Paris in flames.
<p>
(0.3) A well-known economist recently wrote that  "... in order for a competitive equilibrium to exist, each person must prepare a complete list of all future states of the environment which might obtain. And everyone must hold absolutely identical and correct beliefs regarding the prices which would exist in each potential state of the world at every point in the future. This is a world which, transparently, bears no resemblance to reality." (Paul Ormerod, "The Death of Economics", p.89)
<p>
(0.4) We quite agree. But: each person? Beliefs? NEO-FUTURISM puts an end to all that. Anthropomorphic environments in flames.
<p>
(0.5) The environment is imperceptible auto-production: a process, not a container. Human technics began as counter-environments, automatic and 
 robot controls, tools for natural and social domination; became immanent to the environment, and spawned a proliferating series of new counter-environments to limit the functioning of the old ones. At least some semblance of equilibrium was maintained in this simulation. Intelligent technics slip through the net of counter-environments and out of control, into the harsh swarming of dynamic equilibria. At the end of history, no-one will be there to put the brakes on positive feedback systems.
<p>
(0.6) The main questions are temporal and pragmatic: how does it work? What are the conditions for its survival? Econometric divination is completely dysfunctional. NEO-FUTURISM operates as self-generating theoretical hype: it survives or dies on the basis of its trading on its estimated future value. It gambles. The virtual future bleeds into medium-term tactical planning, energizing its selection processes; icing short-term consensus in autistic panic; while replicating systems of catastrophic bifurcations (runaway accumulation and/or loss) which send the long-term into oblivion.
<p>
(0.7) NEO-FUTURISM only searches for these bifurcation points in order to make circuit diagrams which hack into the positive motion of the vortex of postmodern capital. It  is the reverse of nihilism. Its negative moment is inseparable from the positive, smooth operation of its desiring machines - producing soft weaponry to overcome possible obstacles.
<p>
(0.8) NEO-FUTURIST ATTACK DEPENDS UPON THE INTEGRAL UNITY OF ITS TARGET. IT DOES NOT LIVE TO MOUNT ENDLESS, OPPOSITIONAL CRITIQUES. IT 
 OPERATES AS AN IMMANENT POWER OF DISORGANIZATION. IT IS PARASITIC, EXPERIMENTING WITH THE SYMBIOTIC CONDITIONS FOR ITS OWN PROPOGATION INTO THE FUTURE. KATAGENESIS AND ANAGENESIS ARE SWITCHED INTO THE SAME CIRCUIT -  BOTH STORING AND DETONATING EXPLOSIVES.
<p>
(0.9) Space is obsolete: a cultural ghost for tourists with peasant panoptica set on eternity in a cryonic vat. Idiotic gurglings of futurologists: "You and I: we're gonna live forever." California in flames. As global finance evacuates the territory and begins to exchange,  by itself, in an orbital, virtual dimension the city is abolished as a commercial centre. London in flames - a provincial hamlet at best.
<p>
(1.0) Content fades. Media themselves loom large on the edge of planetary cyberblitz. Environmental process transfers from ontology to technology. No more human beings, not even in their hybrid, cyborg variant. Only desiring machines. Cultural studies in flames.
