      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scene could have 
      almost been set up to illustrate Baudrillard's weary polemic. "Any object, 
      any individual, any situation today could be a virtual ready-made ..." (VI 
      99) The ready-made, Baudrillard writes, "extracted from its context, from 
      its idea, from its function, becomes more real than real (hyperrreal) and 
      more art than art (it enters into the transaesthetics of banality, of insignificance, 
      of nullity, where today the pure and indifferent form of art is to be seen)." 
      (VI 99) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Your body feels unbearably 
        heavy. Your head turns lethargically to each exhibit in turn, and then 
        begins again. You feel the same ennui you would reading and re-reading 
        old magazines in a waiting room, then remember, horrified, there's nothing 
        to wait for: this is the event. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A dreadful self-consciousness 
        pervades the whole scene. People carefully and consciously perform the 
        actions that they would have made were they dancing, were they enjoying 
        themselves, carefully simulating, and being seen to be simulating, all 
        the gestures of carefree pleasure . As if sim-life lip-syncing to kitsch 
        classics, moving with the confident self-consciousness of photographic 
        models. Jacques your body... </font>
      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have swallowed 
        our microphones and headsets ... We have interiorized our own prosthetic 
        image and become the professional showmen of our own lives." (VI 96) "No 
        more actions save those that result from an interaction - complete, if 
        possible, with television and built-in feedback." (TE 46) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sim-panopticon, and 
        you're always on stage. Circuiting everything through the automonitor, 
        showing a series of reruns and sim-programs in your place while you theorise 
        yourself into existence. As if ... You're wise enough to know it's impossible 
        to do anything, following commands from the automonitor: DISCLAIM YOUR 
        BODY IMMEDIATELY. Abandon your desiring machines all ye who enter here. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Everything has already 
        been screened, circuited through the auto-monitor, this psychic appendage 
        capable of unlimited metabolisation. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Auto-monitoring PoMo 
        is a machine, but IT ARRIVES LIKE LIGHTNING, sweeping away any evidence 
        of its origins as instantaneously as it establishes its miraculous reign 
        as prime cause of everything. Immanent to its workings is a suppression 
        of intensity behind the screens of representation, epistemology and signification. 
        It's either meaningful or meaningless; in any case, it's saturated with 
        significance. Before anything gets through security it has to check in 
        with the Jacques officers. You have to ask it means to do something rather 
        than just doing it </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PoMo machinery 
        will convert any input into a signifying formula. Whenever anything is 
        working, it will ask: what does it mean? What is it? There's nothing outside 
        the text because nothing gets in unless it's already been textualised, 
        complete with brackets and quotation marks, converted into canon fodder. 
        </font>
      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There is a degree 
        of sleeplessness, of rumination, of the historical sense," Nietzsche wrote 
        in "Untimely Meditations", "which is harmful and ultimately fatal to the 
        living thing whether this living thing be a man or a people or a culture' 
        His scattered accounts of this infinite and infinitely frightful "boundless 
        ocean" forewarn of the throbbing inescapable ache of irony, knowing self-mockery, 
        the interminable stepping in and out of cultural idiom which we might 
        recognise as popular postmodern culture. He concludes: "The oversaturation 
        of an age with history seems to me to be hostile and dangerous to life...It 
        leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself and subsequently 
        into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism." But surely the only danger 
        here is that of a comprehensive neutralization, the second-hand miming 
        of irreverent destruction, a wilful squandering of energy. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Playing in the ruins, 
        then is our game - a desultory and arbitrary sorting though of the mass 
        of valueless junk left at our disposal. Some take a certain glee in this 
        abject practice, a fervour for revival, citation, surreal juxtaposition 
        and all the other characteristic tropes of popular postmodernism. However 
        this is what Nietzsche describes as "Pessimism in decline...as growing 
        effeteness, as a sort of cosmopolitan fingering, as 'tout comprendre' 
        and historicism." </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The cardinal features 
        of PoMo - the arbitrary aesthetics, the simulated gestures, the boredom, 
        the poignancy of the lost object - combine to produce a transcendental 
        miserabilism - a deep sense not only that there is nothing to be done, 
        but that nothing could ever have been done. Zarathustra's Ultimate Man, 
        "inexterminable as the flea" says "irony" and blinks, `They are clever 
        and know everything that has ever happened : so there is no end to their 
        mockery'" (Zarathustra Prologue 5). </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1991 : NO FUTURE 
        (US reprise) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Punk arrives in America: 
        Nirvana on MTV. </font>
      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"... 'Smells Like 
        Teen Spirit' begins as if on Jupiter, where body weight has hideously 
        increased, the music pressed down by a fatigue, lassitude, why-bother: 
        'Never mind ', as Cobain says to kill a line." (ALD 29) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What Cobain's weighed 
        down by above all is the dead heaviness of the past, the overwhelming 
        sense that everything has already been done. When Kurt Cobain first heard 
        the punk records that would excite and inspire him, they were already 
        old news, the fading afterglow of long-extinct stars. He lived, he always 
        knew, in the arid cultural interregnum that Jameson, referring to an ostensibly 
        very different cultural sphere, called "a world in which stylistic innovation 
        is no longer possible, [where] all that is left is to imitate dead styles, 
        to speak through the masks and with the voices of the styles in the imaginary 
        museum. But this means that contemporary or postmodernist art is going 
        to be about art itself in a new kind of way; even more, it means that 
        one of its essential messages will involve the necessary failure of art 
        and the aesthetic, the failure of the new, the imprisonment in the past." 
        (PCS 18) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NO FUTURE had a gleeful 
        edge when Rotten sang it, a sense, not only of being relieved of an obligation 
        to the future , but of being freed from a responsibility to the past . 
        But from where slacker was, Rotten's sneer, even Mclaren's demystifying 
        Svengali strategies, looked as nostalgic as the Silver Jubilee they supposedly 
        opposed. Where the xerox revolution of punk emerged in the wreckage of 
        disciplinary societies , as an escape from the dreary treadmill of school 
        and dead end jobs, Slacker was in a control(led) loop from the start. 
        Its every move anticipated, tracked, bought and sold before it had even 
        happened. Cobain knows that he's just another piece of spectacle, that 
        nothing runs better on MTV than a protest against MTV. Knows that his 
        every move is a cliche, scripted in advance. Knows that even realising 
        it is a cliche. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This epistemological 
        spiral may seem like a runaway ride but at escape velocity it simply goes 
        into a cold orbit, processing everything through the automonitor.The result 
        is a dreadful physical paralysis. "Words take a long time to emerge from 
        this gravity, from Cobain's hoarse, seemingly shredded throat. It might 
        be months on the radio or MTV before you begin to catch what's being said 
        in Nirvana songs - 'sell the kids for food', 'I don't mind if I don't 
        have a mind', 'I feel stupid and contagious', 'I'm neutered and spayed', 
        'at the end of the rainbow and your rope', 'I don't care if it's old' 
        - but the feeling of humiliation, disintegration, of defeat by some distant 
        malevolence, is what the music says by itself." (ALD 29) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's Baudrillard 
        who is the consummate philosopher of Slacker and its correlative physical 
        state, the lethargic couch-potato impotence, the affectless, doped tension-free 
        of the terminally defeated. "One day the image of a person watching a 
        television screen voided by a technicians' strike will be seen as the 
        the perfect epitome of the anthropological reality of the twentieth century." 
        (TE 13) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Metaphoresensic analysis 
        screens events before they happen. They arrive prepackaged and prefiled 
        as niche commodities: tragedy, massacre, political condemnation, all-party 
        talks mediamatically pattern recognised, the extirpation of contingency 
        going hand in hand with the proliferation of categories, vocabulary. The 
        significatory categories have to be established before anything is allowed 
        to "happen". </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When Baudrillard 
        says the Gulf war didn't happen, it's because, on the terminal beaches 
        of PoMo, nothing happens any more. "Events" belong to the past; all that's 
        left are commemorations, anniversaries, revivals, remakes, remodels. Events 
        were precisely that which could have happened differently. The Gulf war, 
        meanwhile, had the scripted inevitability of a TV programme - a carefully 
        designed real-time apocalypse scenario that unfolded as it was broadcast, 
        in an uninterrupted (and uninterruptable) telepresent simultaneity. Which 
        is why the Gulf War played the same symbolic role for Slacker that Vietnam 
        did for the sixties. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Generation X was 
        always out of time: arriving after the orgy, it found itself exiled from 
        the progressivist aspirations of the sixties counterculture and thrown 
        into the seamless temporality of MTV - a temporality Jameson, writing 
        just as MTV was just beginning to broadcast, was already describing when 
        he wrote of "the disappearance of a sense of history, the way in which 
        our entire contemporary social system has little by little begun to lose 
        its capacity to retain its own past, has begun to live in a perpetual 
        present and in a perpetual change..." (PCS 28) But this simultaneous perpetual 
        present is nothing but the endless reiteration of the past: the airless 
        no-time of "the classic", a timeless eternality removed from history because 
        bereft of any sense of contingency. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So while the postmodern 
        scene is obsessed with the past, it is only historicist in the way that 
        Nietzsche's "cosmopolitan fingerers" are. What Jameson has called &ocirc;the 
        nostalgia mode&ouml; is characterised by an atemporal mix &aelig;n' match 
        aesthetic that has moved beyond the model of linear development on which 
        historical narrative is premised. That constantly recurring feature of 
        the postmodern scene, the ironically revived text, is &ocirc; a complex 
        object in which on some level children and adolescents can take the adventures 
        straight, while the adult public is able to gratify a deep and more properly 
        nostalgic desire to return to that older period and to live its strange 
        old artifacts through once again.&ouml; (PCS 19) A deep cynicism lies 
        hidden behind an apparent generosity: Britpop may just be a reheated version 
        of the past, but it is &ocirc;new to the kids&ouml;, giving them &ocirc;a 
        chance to experience what they missed&ouml;. The revived artifact emerges 
        as doubly transcendent, offering a transcendence not only of the present 
        (from which it seeks to escape into a supposedly more coherent past), 
        but also of the very past it affects to fetishise (since ironic distance 
        and a little modification here and there allow us to enjoy the past without 
        the embarrassment of being actually immersed in it) . </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Britpop is only one 
        example of the British version of PoMo which, if anything, is both more 
        cynical and more wistful than its American variant. The interlocking milieux 
        of late-night TV, retropop and graduate comedy, protected by a demystificatory 
        barrier that ensures it won't get fooled again, languishes in the citational 
        abyss of an increasingly friction-free revivalism. We look at the old 
        days with a certain pity, a certain tenderness, and a great condescension: 
        they are what we can never be, unconscious of the great weight of their 
        existence, unembarrassed, whilst we can only simulate, in thrall to the 
        authority of an absent authenticity, slave to a dead god. Enkitschment, 
        or ironical reinvestment, is invariably followed by a sneer at the reconstructed 
        naivete which is, however, cherished despite its apparent embarrassed 
        acquiescence at the hands of PoMo 'cynicism'. A superficial glee accompanied 
        by a nostalgic sigh - if only we could really go back to those simpler 
        times, watching Bagpuss in our nylon Starsky and Hutch T-shirts. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The miserable relativism 
        of PoMo is already invited by the inherent pathos of Kant's metaphysics, 
        backed up by the barely disguised theocide of rationally enforced regulative 
        principles and transcendental simulations (the as if). As the grund falls 
        away, you have to learn to police yourself. The transcendental as a generalized 
        apparatus of capture, locking intelligence into closed circuits, simultaneously 
        produces and fulfils impoverished expectations. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The repressive force 
        of this machine can only be gauged by the absurd amount of energy expended 
        upon its maintenance. PoMo's transcendental miserabilism, a last cubby 
        hole of humanity amidst the swarmachinic rhizome of technocapital, domicile 
        where once was dominion, purposiveness without purpose, constitutes a 
        multi-story "as if" where only a residual conceit secures homeostasis. 
        Fiercely protected, PoMo is all about cults, clubs and cliques. Nothing 
        gets in without prior inoculation. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The shocks to this 
        system come from the darkside, from the unanticipated and unprepared for. 
        What is genuinely new will evade the pre-scripted categories - "the new 
        Beatles", "the new Punk" - which have already neutralised any possible 
        deviation from the already processed. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Technocapital, as 
        generalized decoding machine is the basis of a numerical or synthetic 
        culture whose ability to break down, display and replicate code into asignifying, 
        machinic elements within virtual systems puts it on a line of flight away 
        from all signifying language, unleashing a generalized decoding which 
        irradiates the whole culture. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While decoding doubtless 
        means understanding and translating a code, it also means destroying the 
        code as such, assigning it an archaic, folkloric or residual function 
        (AO 245) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Capitalism displays 
        antithetical tendencies, tenaciously reaffirming redundant cultural forms 
        with one hand while ruthlessly decommissioning them with the other. Bourgeois 
        tragic culture revels in a retro-reactive fascination for these archaisms 
        (kitsch), building them back into the system at the level of ironic simulation 
        (which further strengthens the reflection-reproduction of a self-satisfied 
        human interiority under the great weight of its own poignant degeneration). 
        But regardless of chronological priority, simulation is always secondary 
        to and derivative of synthetics. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The arbitrariness 
        of transcendental simstim regulations does not itself necessitate the 
        reification and metaphorensic examination of this lack of a ground (which 
        itself serves as the basis of transcendental miserabilist aesthetics/ 
        philosophy/ theory). This is more the product of the already existing 
        bourgeois culture and its decadent tendency to translate its own petty 
        problems into grand gestures. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Fed on the endlessly 
        regurgitated brains of dead philosophers, post-structuralism degenerates 
        into the spongiform Hegelianism it always-already was, proudly dwelling 
        on its own desolate but strictly delimited ground while barely concealing 
        its delight that we can't escape from the narratives of modernity. Theory 
        remains tethered to the "post", given over to interminable rumination 
        on what is superseded but, supposedly, never overcome. All texts are pre-texts 
        - also post-texts - flimsy tracing papers colonially irrigated and preemptively 
        captured by reassuringly dull, appropriately academic, subtitles. Pun 
        colon verb definite article academic designation. "Jacquing off, Offing 
        Jacques: Derrida, Lacan and the Self-referentiality of the Academic Subject." 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Rapid response is 
        rendered impossible, the danger of embarrassing oneself by saying something 
        that has not been rigorously automonitored, ruminated over for a punitively 
        extended period of scholarly detention, is too great. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nietzsche's critique 
        of the clogged digestive system of the West's Last Men, itself often perversely 
        interpreted as a metaphor, expresses all too acutely the constipated Eurocontinence 
        of these constricted bodies, themselves minor fascicular elements of a 
        resonant system of transcendental miserabilism disseminated across all 
        levels of culture. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The dreary textocratic 
        dribblings of post-theory are merely the transcendental idealist counterpoint 
        to the empirical realism of postmodern culture. Kurt Cobain embodied what 
        theory disembodies, the raging stomach pains which plagued him finding 
        their disintensified correlate in the the chin-rubbing, brow-furrowing 
        protocols of urbane academic anxiety. Smells like Hegelian Spirit. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By contrast, synthetic 
        culture disorganises the docilising regimes of disciplinary body politics. 
        Hip hop and jungle work on the body, not in the overlit luminotopological 
        epistemoscapes of necrospective mummification, but in the dark zones where 
        you don't have a chance to think about what things would mean before they 
        happen. Effects arrive before objects, scrambling the operating system 
        of the automonitoring signifying apparatus. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Samploid music and 
        video games emerges as the leading probe-heads of synthetic culture precisely 
        because of their overt machinism, their asignifying functionality, their 
        indifference to epistemological conundra brewed up in the depths of the 
        strata. There's nothing to believe in, only a cyberpositive circuit to 
        plug your body into. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The asignifying codes 
        of synthetic culture are not at all to be identified with the great inarticulable 
        deferred transcendental object blearily hallucinated by senescent Bavarian 
        Catholicism and lingua-Francophony neo-communitarian dessicated Judaism 
        in their post-theoretical guises. Materially functional numerical systems, 
        these codes represent nothing, but are real parts of abstract machines, 
        hooking up desiring machines by way of a continually complexifying axiomatic. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What is dissolved 
        in synthetic culture is not commodification per se, but commodity fetishism 
        as it regulates the bourgeois object system, in which everything is assigned 
        a proper place. Synthetic culture sheds no Benjaminite tears for the lost 
        aura of objects in the age of mechanical reproduction, celebrating instead 
        the way in which the subject-object dichotomy and its attendant pathos 
        are reconfigured as machinic circuits in the age of cybernetic replication. 
        "The transaesthetics of banality" plays upon the poignant, if bathetic, 
        aura of found objects, but for abstract culture everything that's ready 
        made, or mass-marketed, is there to be dismantled and relocated into the 
        unfamiliar architectures of the synthetic composition, the "uncanny adjacencies" 
        of the hip hop or jungle track, where they have a machinic, rather than 
        merely a citational, role to play: decomposable elements on a plane of 
        consistency, not cut up fragments. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To the jaded eyes 
        of the PoMophile, sampling can appear to be part of its own aesthetic 
        of incongruent bricolage, yet another example of the crippling self-consciousness 
        bedevilling a culture so exhausted it is fit only to sort through its 
        own entrails. But , far from being imprisoned in the past, synthetic culture 
        unlocks the machinic surplus value in the already actualized, stretching 
        and warping time into nonorganically reprogrammed somatic circuits of 
        inhuman speeds and slownesses. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A breath of fresh 
        air, a little relation to the outside, that's all schizoanalysis asks. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's a matter of 
        synaptic connectivity, crashing the Kantian mainframe, burning the cranial 
        arboretum, switching on desiring machines. </font>
