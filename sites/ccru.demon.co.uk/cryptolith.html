         <P><FONT SIZE=5>In the pass the muttering sickness leaped
         into our throats, coughing and spitting in the silver
         morning, frost on our bones...sick apes spitting blood
         bubbling throats torn with the talk sickness, human faces
         flicking in and out of focus. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE=5>Professor Barker recalls this moment,
         catching the trajectory. He coaxes it across the
         Cataplex-map, snakings, twistings. Scars and vectors
         slot-together. It sticks. Irridium stink of the Entity so
         strong it hisses ...</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>Tick iterations. Ticks, scratches,
         chitterings silt across the Outside. Barker senses its
         passage stroke him, nerve-tense, locked to the distant twin.
         Theta-Station. Antarctic Peninsula. Where it is K112
         forever. He locks in hard against the tug to proximity. Each
         time a little more difficult to Refrain. Last tick of the
         Time-Lapse. A streaking down towards the Yucatan. Tick
         freezing the interrupted Tick. Now it terminates the
         Mesozoic.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>Mother of a killing-mechanism ... ballistic
         vapour wave ... A billion tons of molten calcium toxins,
         spatters out of the impact-crater. Supersonic
         particle-storms erase North America ... Chalk-Out ...</FONT>
         </P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>Ater this it's just scar-tissue,
         Mammal-time, incessant surgical ticking of the Cataplex,
         stuttering, teetering... then the Time-Fault splits your
         memory in two. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>It's to protect you. It insists. Without the
         trauma, the Amnesia, you'd have to think it. You've
         forgotten this. For now. Much later you revert... clawing
         back past the blizzard, tottering into it. Into thinking it.
         The Unutterable. The thought worse than anything in the
         world. You couldn't Refrain.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>K109:11:25. Miskatonic. Barker's Geocosmic
         Theory of Trauma elicits scepticism, confusion. Few
         comprehend what's creeping in. Cryptolith data found eratic,
         vague, and meagre. No support for conceptual exoticisms.
         They think Barker is mad, or want to. It isn't because he
         thinks that the Galaxies Talk and the Earth Screams,
         everyone knows these things, whether they admit it or
         not.</FONT></P>

         Site-29. 13:26 hours. During excavations in the cross-cut
         quartzite splinter-slopes, Barker discovers Anomalous
         Cryptolith, MU Geocatalog Item: IT-277. It Clicks,
         Instantly. A key, or a Ticket. What was KT?</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE=5>It guides you. Channelling. Folding.
         Writhing through itself, catch by rasping catch, tending the
         tentacle trap. It hears you breathing, wrapped tight,
         rodent-panic clutching and sticky right up against the
         mammal-core. Oozing revulsion-sensitivities of the underside
         suck at your fear, each shrunken prey-breath countercoupled
         to labouring rasps, wheezes, grated-whispering, continuously
         re-catching, bubbling, clicking, strobing
         centipede-nightmares, epidermal rasp of the unutterable
         heaving mass, a seething, clicking, poly-tendrilled
         abomination, slime-stroked gill-slits quivering, ticking, as
         they suck and suck on the pitiful mammal sob, maimed ruins,
         beyond the screen, where it feeds you cannot know, and
         cannot stop knowing. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=5>It is here that you are always peeled open,
         folding onto the outside, clicking, sucking, feeding, where
         you are all insides, raw, never numb, already dead,
         unreachable, limit, check, tick, where no protection can
         get, it feeds and sucks, leaving you locked outside your
         inside, with nothing to defend, fleeing the place you never
         leave, where it feeds and sucks, clicking, palpitating,
         mucal-multiplicitousnesses of intra-coiling malignancy that
         mottle and click, tick, feed, endlessly sucking on an ever
         opening rotten-mass of ulceration, where nothing goes,
         unless to tick, feed, suck ... and so it has to think you
         hear, being so close, so it slithers, groping through all
         your outsides, to be there already, when you arrive. </FONT>
