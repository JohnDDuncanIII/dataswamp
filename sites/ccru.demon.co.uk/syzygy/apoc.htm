          How do "aquapocalyptic" narratives about a return to the sea connect 
          with the Millennium Time-Bomb? Maria D’Resario reports on "hyperfictional" 
          and "ethnomathematical" studies of strange goings-on on the Web, and 
          asks: Are the Cyber-Time Cults just the latest craze, or a new Millenial 
          Mythology? * </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">You’ll 
          be familiar with media scare-stories about "Cybergoths". But, according 
          to two young academics at Massachussetts’ Miskatonic University, it’s 
          time to put aside the moral panics about synthetic drugs and cyberspace 
          comas in order to take a more serious look at what the Cybergoths are 
          actually doing.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
          Cybergoths – and the other cultic bodies that are beginning to populate 
          the Net – are not passing crazes, but "sophisticated contemporary belief 
          systems", more akin to popular religion than youth culture. "The Cybergoths 
          are a Cargo-Cult," claims Miskatonic’s Dr Linda Trent. "They integrate 
          technology into their belief system, and transform the past into the 
          future. Or vice versa."</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
          Like the Melanesian syncretic cults who turned Western detritus into 
          religious objects, the Cybergoths use the relics of the information 
          age as the sacred objects of a new mythic system. But Trent, who calls 
          herself an expert in "Fictional Systems", dislikes the term "mythology.""It 
          begs too many questions, and suggests archaism. What the Cybergoth phenomenon 
          shows, really powerfully, is the difficulty in pinpointing where belief 
          systems come from. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="white"><font size="2">In 
          some ways, when you see the remarkable pattern-matching between the 
          Cybergoth system and older belief systems, it’s tempting to see it is 
          a case of revivalism, but that doesn’t seem ultimately persuasive. What 
          needs to be accounted for is the convergences across Time: are they 
          a coincidence? Which poses the further question: what is a coincidence? 
          And that’s what the Cybergoths are all about." Trent says that the Cybergoths 
          are "natives" of Cyberspace, and the emergence of their culture provides 
          a unique opportunity for studying the process of the formation of a 
          belief system as it happens. </font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Trent 
          uses the term "hyperstition" for "cybernetic" belief systems such as 
          these. "It’s not a simple matter of true or false with hyperstitious 
          systems. Belief here doesn’t have a simply passive quality. The situation 
          is closer to the modern phenomenon of hype than to religious belief 
          as we’d ordinarily think about it. Hype actually makes things happen, 
          and uses belief as a positive power. Just because it’s not ‘real’ now, 
          doesn’t mean it won’t be real at some point in the future. And once 
          it’s real, in a sense, it’s always been." One key area of Cybergoth 
          activity is their response to the so-called "Millennium Bug" (the computer 
          glitch caused by the coding convention that renders years as two, rather 
          than four, digits) . </font></p>

        Cybergoths - whose own communications substitute the letter ‘K’ for the 
        cyber-prefix - believe that the attempt to correct the Millennium Bug 
        is in fact a program for "Gregorian Restoration"; that "cyberspace already 
        has a calendar", a calendar counting up from 00 = 1900 to 99 = 1999. To 
        avert the reversion back to 2000=00 (=1900!), the K-Goths advocate not 
        a "return" to the Gregorian calendar, but the "continuation" of an "existing 
        K-calendar", a continuation which will be achieved by adding not 2 extra 
        digits, but one.</font>
      </font></i></font> 
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Instead 
        of celebrating the Year 2000, then, the Cybergoths will be "chilling out" 
        to the year K-100. This, apparently, has brought them into conflict with 
        another ultra-secret web movement called "Hyper-C" whose "chronopolitics" 
        are, if anything, even more weird than those of the K-goths. Little is 
        known about Hyper-C, but its sporadically-issued Internet communiques 
        celebrate the very "return" that the K-calendar is designed to avoid. 
        Hyper-C seem to believe that computers have a message for us: there is 
        only one century, that counts from 0 to 99, forever. "Hyper-C are another 
        Cargo-Cult," says Trent. "But the time system they operate with is very 
        different to that of the Cybergoths. As far as I can glean, their basic 
        drift is that computers should not be tampered with; that the Millennium 
        Time-Bomb will explode western chronology. There are many elements in 
        common with so-called ‘primitive’ time; for instance, the idea that there 
        is only one year. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">One 
        phrase keeps recurring; from [the rap group] Public Enemy: ‘Apocalypse 
        been in effect.’" The name Hyper-C puns on sea and C, connecting the radical 
        biological theory of hypersea (which argues that "life on land" is an 
        extension of the ocean) with key ‘C’ words such as Century, Cybernetics 
        and Cycle. Its shady operations are webbed into a submerged world of what 
        English theorist Kodwo Eshun has called "eso-terrrorism", an "info-war" 
        conducted principally through the (hyper) medium of "sonic fiction". </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        techno outfit Drexciya are only one example of a wave of contemporary 
        eso-terrorists rumoured to be connected with Hyper-C. "In the sleevenotes 
        to the ‘The Quest’, their ‘97 concept double CD," Eshun writes, "Drexciyans 
        are revealed to be a marine species descended from ‘pregnant American-bound 
        African slaves’ thrown overboard ‘by the thousands during labour for being 
        sick and disruptive cargo. Could it be possible for humans to breathe 
        underwater? A foetus in its mother’s womb is certainly alive in an aquatic 
        environment. Is it possible that they could have given birth at sea to 
        babies that never needed air? </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Recent 
        experiments have shown mice able to breathe liquid oxygen, a premature 
        human infant saved from certain death by breathing liquid oxygen through 
        its underdeveloped lungs. These facts combined with reported sightings 
        of Gillmen and Swamp Monsters in the coastal swamps of the Southeastern 
        United States make the slave trade theory startlingly feasible.’" Drexicya 
        are part of the "hypersitious" network described by Eshun in his recent 
        * More Brilliant than the Sun: Adventures in Sonic Fiction*, a network 
        that includes Sun Ra, Public Enemy, George Clinton and Underground Resistance. 
        For Eshun, a crucial theme in the sonic "discontinuum" he describes is 
        abduction. "The idea of alien abduction," he explains, "means that we’ve 
        all been living in an alien-nation since the 18th century. The mutation 
        of the African male and female slaves in the 18th century into what became 
        negro, and into the entire series of humans that were designed in America."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Abduction, of course, has been a major preoccupation in the recent coverage 
        of the Cybergoths, with outraged families complaining of their children 
        being swallowed into a world of artificial drugs and schizophrenia. What 
        abduction is really about, according to Trent, is "missing time." "What’s 
        happening out there?" she asks. "In a sense, you have to have been abducted 
        to find out." For Trent, the struggle between Hyper-C and the Cybergoths 
        is part of an ongoing "time war" ("a war that’s only going to get worse, 
        and which will affect all of us"). The Cybergoths have what Dr Trent calls 
        an "extremely sophisticated" philosophy of time. "They use two interrelated 
        diagrams or graphizations: the ‘Barker’ spiral and the ‘Stillwell’ Numogram 
        (which includes the Pentazygon)."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        "The Barker spiral maps a simple set of numeric relations, but these relations 
        have enormously complex implications," insists Dr Polly Wolfe, a colleague 
        of Trent’s on Miskatonic’s Time-Lapse sub-committee. On one side of the 
        spiral, Wolfe explains, all the numbers add up to 10 ( 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 
        4+6, 5+5); on the other, "occulted" side, 10 is subtracted, and all the 
        numbers are "twinned" to make up 9 (0 +9, 1+8, 2+7, 3+6, 4+5). Important 
        here is the operation of "digital reduction", in which any number can 
        be reduced to a figure between 1 and 9, by adding up its component numerals: 
        for instance, 16 = 1+6 = 7, 17 = 1+7 = 8, etc. One of the many odd effects 
        Wolfe describes is the interchangable role of 9 and 0. "In digital reduction, 
        9 always functions as 0. Try it out. Take, let’s say, 92: it = 9 + 2 = 
        11 = 1 + 1 = 2. The same applies for any number including 9. In a sense, 
        you can just ignore the 9 – but only because 9, like 0, is everywhere." 
        "The Numogram could, in some ways, be seen as an elaboration of the Spiral," 
        Wolfe goes on. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        numogram describes relations that emerge by combining the operations of 
        digital reduction with those of "triangular numbering". In triangular 
        numbering, you add up the sum of all the numbers in the numner-line up 
        to and including the number you are dealing with; for example, 3 becomes 
        6: 3 = 1+2+3= 6. 9=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= 45 (which, interestingly, digitally 
        reduces to [4+5 =] 9). Wolfe styles herself an "Aftermathematician" or 
        "Mechanomist." "I’m a dabbler," she said . "I like to see how numbers 
        behave; I’m not interested in reducing them to instantiations of some 
        pre-existing logical system." By contrast, Wolfe insists, insitutionalized 
        mathematics can be defined by its "hostility to numbers." Dr Wolfe takes 
        seriously the so-called "numerological" traditions orthodox mathematics 
        has defined itself against, noting the correspondences between the radical 
        proto-"aftermathematical" theories she is interested in – Cantor’s transfinite 
        numbers, Godel’s diagonal numbering – and older, "vernacular numeric systems". 
        "If you look at the work ethnomathematicians like [Ohio State University’s] 
        Ron Eglash are doing, you see examples of exactly the kinds of strange 
        looped coincidences and odd doublings Linda is interested in. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        one piece, Eglash describes the parallels between Senagelese sand divination 
        systems and the Cantor set. No-one is seriously suggesting that there 
        is a line of influence or evolution here; there are parallel routes to 
        the same discovery. Numbers and what they do are no more something we 
        invent than they’re already sitting in some Platonic heaven." Hence mechanomics. 
        "Mech because numeric dabbling is not representational, but practical. 
        Following what numbers do is an act of production, but only because all 
        production is really a matter of discovery not ex nihilo creation. Making 
        things up is always a matter of subtracting from zero."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Of 
        key importance here is the role of "infinitesimals", which, according 
        to Wolfe, are a major theme in "Gothic numerics". The term Gothic is "not 
        idle. Differential calculus was once dismissed as a ‘Gothic hypothesis’, 
        since it posits quantities irreducible to standard unitary quantification. 
        In a way, zero – so controversial when introduced into Europe – is itself 
        a Gothic quantity. And what the cybergoths call ‘Uttunul’ is crucially 
        connected with Cantorian continuum." "Uttunul" is one of the five "entities" 
        that populate the Cybergoth system. ("It’s wrong, strictly speaking, to 
        describe the system as belonging to the Cybergoths," Trent interjects. 
        "They use it, but its origins are very mysterious." ) The five entities 
        each correspond to a "Barker-twinning" or "Syzygy", the pairings which 
        make up 9 (1/8, 2/7, 3/6, 5/4, 9/0) and which together constitute the 
        "Pentazygon" ("Five-twin"). The first three of these beings make up "the 
        cycle of time", whilst the other two are – in some sense – "outside" sequential 
        time. The cycle the system describes, Trent points out, is "multi-levelled"; 
        it is also, for instance, also a story about the journey from land to 
        sea and back again. Katak.(5/4) is "associated with the desert, with heat 
        haze and shimmer. In many ways, its key features – claw marks, teeth – 
        seem to recall werewolf legends. Its time is a time of cataclysm; its 
        appearance always presages disaster. Sometimes imaged as an hydrophobic 
        or rabid dog, Katak can partly be characterised by a horror of what will 
        supercede it in the cycle, Mur Mur (1/8), the Dreaming demon of submersion. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Mur 
        Mur, meanwhile, carries echoes of the legends of Sea Beasts and ancient 
        serpents; its time is the Deep Time of the ocean bed. Like Katak, it too, 
        is horrified by what will follow it in the cycle; in this case, Oddubb 
        (2/7), the amphibious entity, associated with the crossing out of water 
        and the acquisition of lungs. What Mur Mur fears is the division that 
        Oddubb brings, the splitting of the undivided waters. Oddubb is defined 
        by ambiguous and elusive movement. As its name suggests, it is a ‘double-agency’, 
        a duplicitous creature. It has a horror of dryness, of the state of being 
        fully landlocked that comes with Katak. Which brings us full circle." 
        The two entities that are "outside time" - Djynxx (3/6) - "a changeling 
        figure, defined by a jinking (eratic or zig-zagging) movement, a sudden 
        cutting in or out" – and Uttunul (9/0), the "flatline" entity, connoting 
        "continuum, zero-intensity, void – eternity not as infinitely extended 
        time, but as No-Time" – are in many ways the most fascinating and disturbing 
        of the set, associated as they are, for Trent, with old mythologies of 
        "child abduction" and Hell. But is all this merely an attempt to populate 
        a disenchanted world with old gods? Or is cyberspace – and the world – 
        really crawling with these creatures? "Perhaps it’s all make-believe," 
        Trent smiles enigmatically. "But don’t underestimate the power of belief 
        to make things happen…"</font></p>
