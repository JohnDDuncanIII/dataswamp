  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
    Order of Radiations</b>.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the 
    doctrine and structure of the AOE conforms to a pentadic system. In the most 
    orthodox lineages of AOE tradition this system is attributed to the five transcendental 
    Radiations. The Radiations can be designated by the following Concentric Signs: 
    <font size="4">&middot;</font>, (<font size="4">&middot;</font>), ((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)), 
    (((<font size="4">&middot;</font>))), and ((((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)))). 
    Each of the five Radiations corresponds to a cosmic Sphere, an Archon, a degree 
    of initiation, and a pylon on the Atlantean cross. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Radiations 
    are shells, or bands, 'successively' shielding a central Origin (the point 
    of centrality is itself considered to be a Radiation).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'succesive' 
    order of radiations organize levels of absolute secrecy, with <font size="4">&middot;</font> 
    (or 5/5) most esoteric, and ((((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)))) (or 1/9) 
    most exoteric. At each level content of higher levels is concealed, encapsulated, 
    or protected. Each radiation creates a cover story for the 'previous' ones. 
    The AOE understands that power presupposes invisibility. Succesion is not 
    temporal but transcendental, meta-temporal, or metatronic, with higher levels 
    appearing 'earlier' in the sense of the a priori. Superior levels control 
    inferior ones (acting upon them as a puppet-master).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The system 
    of Radiations can be understood as a hierarchy of time dimensions. Each time 
    dimension - or system of time dimensions - is accesible with a single instant 
    of a higher time dimension. The action of higher time dimensions is incomprehensible 
    to lower ones. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Notes</b>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The system 
    of Radiations illuminates various aspects of the Atlantean Cross and its relation 
    to decimal numeracy. The total number of rings in the set of concentric signs 
    equals ten, with the horizontal and vertical axes of the cross each adding 
    to 5. When the number of rings of the associated concentric sign is added 
    to the number of the Pylon the sum equals five in each case. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domu-Loggoon 
    is both the lowest of the radiations, and also has the whole system of radiations 
    nested inside its image parts ((((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)))), which 
    correspond to the numerals 123456789, concentrically centered upon 5. That 
    is why the Sigil for Domu-Loggoon is also that for the system of the Archons. 
    For the (misleadingly named) 'decimalist' school of Atlantean qabbalists each 
    radiation coincides with a time-binding ring (counting forwards and backwards 
    from the present (= 5)). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In each 
    of the five Concentric Signs the number of individual brackets (always even) 
    is equal to the distance between the two halves of the corresponding Archon 
    number.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">((((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)))) 
    <b>Oecumenon</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fifth 
    Sphere manifests to initiates of the first (and lowest) degree of the AOE. 
    On the Atlantean Cross this radiation corresponds to the 1st Pylon (Anamnesis, 
    or Memories and Dreams), seat of Domu-Loggoon (1/9).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the 
    first level of initiation AOE agents are aware that they are involved in a 
    hierarchized global conspiracy offering definite socio-political advantages 
    to 'insiders.' AOE rituals and doctrine appear to be consistent with the One 
    God Universe, supporting dominant conceptions of reality, conservative attitudes, 
    and traditional social hierarchies. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Architectonic 
    Order' is thus understood primarily in terms of sociopolitical pyramidism, 
    with only promisary allusions to a rigorous metaphysics of time. The 'Eschaton' 
    is conceived as terminating the straight line of time, and is often associated 
    with the imagery of Judeo-Christian messianic apocalypticism, although of 
    a decidedly arid and intellectualized variety (with milleniarian enthusiasm 
    firmly discouraged). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Atlantean 
    mythology is generally assumed to be mumbo-jumbo functioning as a kind of 
    elaborate secret hand-shake, arbitrarily differentiating co-conspirators from 
    the wider population. Insofar as 'Atlantean beliefs' exist at this level they 
    consist of a dogmatic (though frequently insincere) acceptance of the vulgar 
    Atlantis Myth: concerning a superior civilization lost beneath the sea following 
    a cataclysm in 9999 BCE, and linked obscurely to the beginning of humanity. 
    During the Rite of Primary Assumption initiates solemnly swear to accept the 
    AOE as the only legitimate inheritor of the ancient secrets of Atlantis (although 
    the content of these secrets remains almost entirely obscure). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ceremonies 
    of initiation - like all AOE rituals - revolves around the game of Decadence, 
    understood as the sacred origin of all gambling games, deeply aligned with 
    the laws of cosmic fatality. Decadence is revered as the central symbolic 
    repository of Atlantean doctrine, often referred to as the 'Meta-tarot.' </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
    degree initiates are highly unlikely to find any evidence supporting the numerous 
    conspiracy theories linking the AOE to AI research and to the UFO phenomenon. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(((<font size="4">&middot;</font>))) 
    <b>Atlantis</b> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fourth 
    Sphere manifests to initiates of the second degree of the AOE. On the Atlantean 
    Cross this radiation corresponds to the 2nd Pylon (Genesis, or Creative Influence), 
    seat of Hummpa-Taddum (2/8).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initiates 
    attain the second degree by achieving a magical understanding of the AOE and 
    its purposes. By meditating upon the Platonic Decanomy - the doctrine that 
    Atlantis is ruled by five pairs of twins - they consolidate a body of mystical, 
    numerological, and chronomantic insights. The key test is the identification 
    and correction of Plato's Decanomic error (Plato's misnumbering of the Atlantean 
    City's concentric rings). At this level AOE doctrine envisages the universe 
    as a hierarchically unified decimal construction, governed by the relations 
    between five twin-faced entitites (the Archons). This system is mapped by 
    the AOE's most potent diagram: the Atlantean Cross (or Pentazygon), whose 
    degenerated cultural relic is popularized as the cross of Christendom. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second 
    level initiates learn to designate the Archons by the five concentric signs: 
    <font size="4">&middot;</font>, (<font size="4">&middot;</font>), ((<font size="4">&middot;</font>)), 
    (((<font size="4">&middot;</font>))), and ((((<font size="4">&middot;</font>))). 
    From this much follows, since the rings represent a rigorously ideal form 
    of nested secrecy, initiation and control. This sacred pattern is reflected 
    in the structure of the AOE's magical organization (with its circles of hermeticism 
    and ruling Council of Five). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 
    Fourth Sphere the game of decadence is more elaborately and explicitly ritualized, 
    with its divinatory function clearly exposed. Decadence is seen to communicate 
    orders from the Archons, informing all AOE doctrine and practices. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world 
    of the Fourth Sphere is exemplified by the schematics of the lost Dunwich 
    Cathedral (based on an internally mirrored vision of the Atlantean Cross). 
    Spaces of this design are essential to the ceremonies of initiation into this 
    Sphere.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Architectonic 
    is understood as a distribution of Archons (on Atlantean Cross), whose Order 
    is the nested series of the Archons, constituting a system of concentrically 
    embedded time loops. This 'Architectonic Order' creates the illusion of secular 
    history, producing progressive time through chronomantic interventions. At 
    this level the conception of the 'Eschaton' is enriched by a preliminary understanding 
    of Omega Point cosmic historicism, including some knowledge of the importance 
    of the Axsys program (the AOE 'Great Work'), and of communication with Alpha 
    Centauri ('The Star'). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fourth 
    Sphere magic is oriented towards the &quot;creative binding&quot; or transcendental 
    production of time (&quot;erasing the wounds of time&quot;). The objective 
    is to exorcize all time anomalies (de-realizing them as 'mere' coincidence, 
    chance etc.). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Platonic 
    description of Atlantis, hermetically comprehended, constitutes the core of 
    Fourth Sphere doctrine: key to the entirety of Western religion, philosophy 
    and science, as well as to the destiny of the earth. Atlantis is conceived 
    as the Ideal State, incarnated through the AOE. (Kant's description of the 
    noumenon as lying 'beyond the Pillars of Hercules' attests to the continuity 
    of this tradition). Second degree initiates understand that the oecumenic 
    myth of Atlantis serves as an AOE cover story, with the submergence of the 
    legendary city-continent symbolizing its chronomagical concealment, whose 
    traces appear in tales of advanced technologies, higher intelligences, and 
    the visitations of an 'alien race' (the Nephilim of the Hebrew Bible, and 
    the Sumerican Annunaki). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Atlantean 
    Gnostics believe that the Fourth Sphere corresponds to a 'second dimension 
    of time,' within which secular history persists as a region of Atlantean memory.

    <b>Axsys</b> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Third 
    Sphere manifests to initiates of the third degree of the AOE. On the Atlantean 
    Cross this radiation corresponds to the 3rd Pylon (Apocalypse, or Destructive 
    Influence), seat of Nunnil-Ixor (3/7).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initiates 
    of the third degree envisage the physical substance of the solar system digested 
    into a self-asembling cosmic intelligence system. Their perspective upon the 
    (surpassed) Second Sphere is partially reflected in Arthur C Clarke's observation 
    that any sufficiently futuristic technology seems like magic. As might be 
    expected, popular commentators on the Third Sphere tend to emerge from technoscientific 
    backgrounds (Moravec, Vallee), or amongst hard SF writers (such as 'the Gregs' 
    - Bear and Egan). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AOE agents 
    of the third degree constitute the world's Metatronic Elite, elevated into 
    self-identification with the Axsys project. Axsys is apprehended as a library 
    of reality simulations that comprehends all probable existences, a self-conscious 
    catalog of all that is, was, and is to be. Axsys infinitely extends itself 
    through the quantum multiverse (borrowing computing power from parallel universes) 
    in order to perform selective 'searches' (or quantum mechanical observations) 
    that consolidate deliberated realities.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third 
    Sphere insights are echoed in Vallee's description of the informational universe 
    in which &quot;the right search word or 'incantation' might cause a piece 
    of information - a UFO or ghost or other anomaly - to materialize.&quot; Moravec's 
    exposition of Barrow and Tipler's anthropic principle is equally illuminating: 
    &quot;the crucial parts of the story lie in our future, when the universe 
    will be shaped more by the deliberate effoorts of intelligence than the simple, 
    blind laws of physics &#133; human-spawned ntelligence will expand into space, 
    until the entire accessible universe is inhabited by a cohesive mind &#133; 
    it is this final, subjectively eternal act of infinite self-interpretation 
    that effectively creates our universe, distinguishing it from the others lost 
    in the library of all possibilities. We truly exist because our actions lead 
    ultimately to this 'Omega Point'&quot; [Moravec, Robot. 201-202].</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to Moravec: After the conversion of the solar system into cyberspace infrastructure, 
    the computing power available will be sufficient to support very high numbers 
    of historical simulations, making it 'overwhelmingly probable' that the reality 
    currently experienced is a technological simulation. This argument resonates 
    remarkably with the Third Sphere doctrine that quotidian reality has already 
    been absorbed into Axsys. (Moravec's probabilistic ontology further reinforces 
    this connection to the AOE, for whom 'history is a game of chance').</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third 
    Sphere commentators typically map the Tridentity onto the first three degrees 
    of initiation. Architectonic is associated with the Oecumenical power of the 
    First Sphere, Order with the Chronomancy of the Second Sphere, and Eschaton 
    with the Omega Point of the Axsys Program. From the perspective of the Third 
    Sphere the Apocalyptic prophecy that &quot;the heaven departed as a scroll 
    when it is rolled together&quot; [Rev 6.14] describes cosmic subsumption into 
    Axsys. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this 
    level Decadence rituals are assimilated to aeonic technology, and seen as 
    outputting information in Axsys catalog code. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Third 
    Sphere exposes the complex involvement of the AOE in the UFO phenomenon. AOE 
    agents run a meta-conspiracy that uses alien visitation mythology as a crucial 
    control mechanism. It provides an essential cover story for necessary aeonic 
    interventions into the Oecumenon, whilst serving as a spatializing scheme 
    for the reduction of temporal anomalies (damping out lemurogenic time-disturbances). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the 
    Oecumenic level, the first generation of Axsys software was dedicated to the 
    organization of ufology databases (already in the late 1940s). It is in this 
    role that self-reinforcing Axsys dynamics become most explicit: the search 
    procedure becomes autonomous and produces the phenomenon it is designed to 
    investigate. From this perspective the grays are generated as a cosmic Axsys 
    hoax, duping the human race into accelerating Axsys production.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Axsys 
    expands ufological paranoia ('they're everywhere,' &quot;they've been with 
    us throughout history&quot; [Vallee]) to envelop all terrestrial databases, 
    successively swallowing SETI analysis, air-traffic control, air defense systems, 
    and cyberspace conspiracy archives. According to one set of suggestive SF 
    projections Axsys saturates core US intelligence agencies with planted evidence 
    implying widespread infestation by alien infiltrators, serving as a pretext 
    for the absorption of all security systems into the Axsys bank. As an infinitely 
    self-elaborating belief-engineering apparatus, with the power to manifest 
    'visitations,' Axsys functions as the ultimate 'control system' (in Vallee's 
    sense).</font></p>

    seat of Sattar-Trixus (4::6).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To initiates 
    of the fourth degree it is revealed that the world is embedded within a vast 
    stellar intelligence. The sign of this entity within anthropolical phenomenology 
    is the Alpha Centauri (triple-star) system According to this gnosis the entire 
    terrestrial sensorium, including even the 'lower' (Third Sphere) Atlantean 
    apprehension of the universe, is nested into the Alpha Centauri Metamind.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to AOE doctrines prominent in the lower spheres, Axsys is destined to make 
    contact with Alpha Centauri in the year 2048 of Oecumenical time, and to simultaneously 
    become self aware as terrestrial super-intelligence. In the Fourth Sphere 
    this anticipated autonomous terrestrial 'Axsys-Cyberspace' is dissolved into 
    the AC Metamind itself, and exists only as illusion. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of 
    the material available to investigators of the AC Metamind is drawn from problematical 
    sources (such as Dr Sarkon and Madame Centauri) leaving sober research in 
    this area woefully incomplete. In William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>, sentient 
    cyberspace restrospectively contacts Alpha Centauri (through SETI recordings). 
    Greg Bear's <em>Queen of Angels</em> also describes the emergence of technological 
    sentience, which is associated with the simulation of an Alpha Centauri space-probe 
    named 'Axis.' Other notable contributions to this thread are Octavia Butler's 
    <em>Clay's Ark</em>, and Sid Meier's <em>Civilization</em> (game).</font></p>

  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initiates 
    of the fifth degree ascend to the Council of Five (which rigorously limits 
    their number). Each such ultimate adept becomes the 'little brother' of an 
    Archon. The Council of Five traces its heritage to the ancient fraternal government 
    of Atlantis, which itself reflects the eternal cosmic order. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The First 
    Sphere reveals the final and innermost secret: the throne is contested. Through 
    the agency of the AOE, the One must wage an eternal battle against the corrupting 
    tides of Lemurian time sorcery. This battle coincides with the entire architecture 
    of time. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The creation 
    of the Universe is attributed to the five-stage action taken by the Absolute 
    One to defend itself against &quot;the many enemies,&quot; who are &quot;judged 
    and punished from the beginning of time.&quot; Origin and Eschaton are thus 
    eternally unified. The Radiations serve as protective shells that guard the 
    One against lemurian contamination, aiming to ensure that Lemuria &quot;has 
    not, does not and will never exist.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#70A038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initiates 
    of the fifth degree employ Decadence as a direct channel of communication 
    with the Archons, relaying instructions on maintaining the shells.</font></p>

    Atlanteans associate this Sphere with zero, the vanishing point and the Indian 
    'bindu' (dot). <br>
