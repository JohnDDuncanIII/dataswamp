  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>The 
    following is an extract from Rev Martin Bergmann's Good Friday Sermon, Easter 
    1998, given a few months before his untimely death. A number of parties - 
    including the shady Vatican lodge P2 - have been implicated in Bergmann's 
    death; some say that he was killed because he was about to make public a &quot;terrible 
    revelation&quot; about &quot;the Powers that Be.&quot; The transcription of 
    the sermon was presented to the Ccru by Bergmann's editor and confidante, 
    Rev Colin Wemmick. Rev Wemmick points out that &quot;although the balance 
    of Martin's mind was clearly disturbed at this point in his life, it is to 
    be hoped that a generous audience can recognize in these words the undiminished 
    importance of the Bergmannite challenge to Established Christian doctrine 
    . It would be a great comfort to Martin's many powerful enemies if his denunciations 
    of the Established Order were considered unhinged ravings.&quot;</em></font></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#669933">We are here to celebrate the rebirth of Our Redeemer. 
    I tell you there is nothing to celebrate, in rebirth, in birth or in redemption.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Birth is the slimy gateway into Corruption since, as 
    soon as One is born, it participates in Creation and Creation is abomination. 
    Sheer corruption. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Look around you. Can you doubt that we live in the 
    Kingdom of Lies? When the liar St Paul tells us we see as through a glass 
    darkly for once he speaks truly. Those who are exalted - our Masters - the 
    Roman Emperors and their officers - are ministers of a secular hell. Already 
    burning, (so in pain as to be numb to their own agony) they organize the living 
    dead in an orgy of empty pleasures.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">All faith lost.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">That in which you have faith, you cannot doubt. Where 
    there is belief, there is doubt. The Father asks you to believe in him: Therefore, 
    you cannot have faith in Him.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">How does God know he's the Father? Let me tell you 
    the real story of Creation. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">The Father is an autist - deluded from birth into believing 
    he made everything. His true name is Azathoth the Blind Idiot God.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">When he begets Creation - which is the realm of Falsity 
    - the Great One forgets the horror of Zero - the reality of Utter Nothingness 
    which is the true God.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Let me tell you the real story of Easter. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">How can this not be a case of child abuse? How can 
    we worship a Father Who tortures and kills his own child? Do not be fooled: 
    resurrection does not expiate the Father's crime.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">When Christ arises again - as zombie God - It is to 
    be absorbed into his Father's shining body. Christ is the difference between 
    the Father and Himself cancelled to make All Things Equal.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">This is what we celebrate with our Christian calendar. 
    The murder of Zero - killed with all the Innocents which die that the Great 
    One may triumph. The Fathers always sacrifice the children by murder, mutilation 
    or slow poisoning. Christ (Or Cryos, his Secret and True Name) is the sacrifice 
    offered by the Almighty that He did not ask Abraham to make.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Do not seek what will redeem you. There is no redemption. 
    No final judgement. No rewards. No punishments. Just defeat, sputum coughs, 
    last gasps.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">So do not seek out redemption. Seek that which will 
    allow you to escape the Time of Creation and its Prison, which is the passional 
    body: the body - wracked with agony, endlessly tormented - which we celebrate 
    on our symbol of Corruption, the Crucifix.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Your nose to smell with.<br>
    Your eyes to see with.<br>
    Your fingers to touch with.<br>
    Your ears to hear with.<br>
    Your mouth to taste with.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">All of them blocking you from finding your real body.<br>
    Which has never existed.<br>
    Which has never lived.<br>
    Which has never been Created.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Celebrate the Christ Who is stolen from Old Father 
    Time, who abducts the children from the Patriarch's gnarled grasp.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Blessed is that which never lives.<br>
    That which is unborn.<br>
    And you are that Outside Creation.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Hallowed be the Seething Void!<br>
    </font></p>
