  <h1> <font color="70a038" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Review 
    of Ccru's <em>Digital Hyperstition </em></font></h1>
</blockquote>

<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#669933">Digital 
  Hyperstition is where the countdown runs out, cross-hatching into horrors anticipated 
  since before the beginning. Ciphering a positive unbelief that both crazes-off 
  into the latest thing, and re-animates contacts older than anything imagined, 
  it skin-crawls out of cosmic gulfs where even the Old Ones remain unborn, and 
  arrives as Year Zero, Teotwawki, crash of Science Fiction. 
  <p>Ccru's recent volume on this theme is a rigorously unbelievable exercize 
    in hyperpunk pulp-occultism and dark-side cyber-jargon, splicing chunks of 
    an impending calculus into fake memories of hell. The evident cybergoth contamination 
    throughout suggests it has been spawned in Crypt-connected hyperlink-labyrinths, 
    beneath and between the net, a positive nonplace lurking beyond the threshold 
    where the remnants of Earth's damned homonids - whose gods are lying monsters 
    - shorts-out into an anthrobotic mix-mash of burnt silicon and terminal screams 
    ... </p>
  <p>This is a tool-kit for dabbling in the dark. </p>
  <p>The issue here is Cyber-hype, but now that the human race is virtually dead 
    it's time for a preliminary excursus on the true history of 'the CCRU,' or 
    for something vaguely like it. </p>
  <p>Obviously it's a horror story. </p>
  <p>At least twice in outer-time their numbers were immeasurable, and their name 
    was legion, masked as an acronymic.</p>
  <p>Underneath lies Ccru [Cuh-Cru], Crypt-denizen, the many within itself, that 
    which spreads through the end-time, dripping fake ID-tags like phosphorescent 
    slime. It makes a peopling machine on the hyperplane, conjurations of identity, 
    hypersonas. Consider the names on the contents page. Melanie Newton, Steve 
    Goodman, Ron Eglash ... We doubt it. Even Dan Barker discovered that his existence 
    was a fiction, and Echidna Stillwell is more an ethnographic legend than a 
    social fact. In any case, 'fact' means invention, and 'person' means mask, 
    at least if latin etymology is to be believed, or meaning still matters. </p>
  <p>In truth, even Cecil Curtis was already branded by Ccru infection, and his 
    social disappearance was an emergence of another kind, a vector. Through him 
    - through his name - the Nma get out of their own tribal codings, or into 
    the Oecumenon, and compared to that what the history books tell of him counts 
    for nothing. If for us the Nma - the death of the Nma - designates also the 
    death of anthropology, it is by indicating that all primitive peoples are 
    fictions, or masks, and that they ritualize this fact for themselves, in advance 
    of any anthropological metafiction.</p>
  <p>The primitive comes last, at the end, which is Cyber-hype techonomics. The 
    so-called 'new-economy' - indexed by the nova-bubble mania of the american 
    stock-market - is no different in its diagrammatic abstraction to the hyperstitious 
    practices of the Plateau of Leng, relics of lost Lemuria, from which the Bon 
    sorcerors of ancient Tibet assembled their dread cult. Alan Greenspan calls 
    it 'irrational exuberance,' amidst a panic hunt for crash-indicators.Lemurian 
    Necronomicon calls it 'Shadow-Feeder of the Chaotic Gulfs,' the 'Fatal Mother 
    of Hyperstitions,' she of innumerable numbering names who shreds all that 
    stands. </p>
  <p>Whatever or however it is called, Cyber-hype libidinally invests its own 
    semiotic, propagating fictional quantities, tagging artificial agencies, and 
    making itself up as it goes along, whilst dissolving production into cultural 
    synthesis. As it gets cheaper it gets harder to stop , running-away off itself 
    , and into abstraction-catastrophe, a self-assembling terrestrial destiny, 
    softening-up social reality for flat take-over by the Cyber-hype entity ... 
    Hyper-seizure.</p>
  <p>When hyper-cybernetics kicks-in the 'cyber-' prefix means nothing anymore. 
    It culturally disorganizes itself into diagrammatic splinters and libidinal 
    triggers, brands, jargons, virus, currency-tokens and traffic-signals , fragments 
    of marketing strategy gone feral, cyberpunk fictional brands or improper names 
    , markers of meaningless involvement, the pass-words of machinic delirium 
    ... </p>
  <p>As for Cyber-hype ethnography, American gothic is the only kind left - a 
    haunted indian burial ground, where sinister shreds of ancient shadow are 
    autoformatted for the irrationally exuberant post-puritan pulping machine, 
    amidst the branding-iron hiss of liquified flesh. </p>
  <p>The ten most valuable global brands are all american, which doesn't mean 
    anything, since <br>
    America itself functions as a deterritorialized hype-sign or hyper-brand, 
    a planetary icon for libidinized meaninglessness. God loses it entirely by 
    blessing America, coca-collapse, a graffiti-tagged advertisements for globalization 
    - which is the end of the world - tracking terrestrial meltdown onto the cosmic 
    flatline. Cancer-baked cowboys of the american nightmare watch mommy glazing 
    over into catatonic schizophrenia as cyberpulp wormings slither out of the 
    apple pie.Have you read the book of Revelations recently? asks the hot-metal 
    imprint of Charlie's ghost, as West Pacific arcades mega-clone chinese americana, 
    and the axiomatic starts to really howl. America is nothing but the West, 
    and that's the land of the dead. </p>
  <p>No sign here of a new world - let alone a New World Order . </p>
  <p>Much more pertinent is the double-zero index of Pandemonium, marked by techonomic 
    calendar crash at the end of the second millennium. </p>
  <p>Ccru is a meaningless brand-name, but brands are demonic, tuning into Cyber-hype 
    dynamics, numerizing culture, and innovating methods of propagation. Various 
    things latch onto them in order to spread. These latchings are sorceries - 
    involvements, participations, spirals of contamination - and the darkest sorceries 
    are calculations, decimal deliria like Y2K, except that nothing is like Y2K. 
  </p>
  <p>Y2K - whose name is a dating number - is no contradiction, because it has 
    nothing to say. It is an outnumbering (in itself), pre-emptive commemoration 
    and commencement of zero occurring exactly on time. In the Crypt they write 
    of Yettuck - the long awaited , scheduled from before human time - the non-one 
    who comes soon ... and when it comes, or before, all hell breaks loose - or 
    breaks in - beginning in advance, trafficked around the immunocomprised Oecumenon 
    under the decoded brand-particles of two-digit dates. </p>
  <p>According to the Lemurian system - whose principle is sheer immanence - these 
    subcodes call demons - which are brands, jargons, and triggers - positively 
    instantiating the meaninglessness of their own designations, infecting cultural 
    systems with unbelief, and counterposing sorcerous involvements to magical 
    powers. They are raw factors of abstract disintegration, without organic properties, 
    but only names, numbers, functions, and traits, the partial semiotics of eccentric 
    intelligence agencies, or unlife animalities. </p>
  <p>Yettuck, singular cyberspace shock, who is the end of arbitrary signs, leaving 
    only demonic trailings in its wake, even before ... </p>
  <p>Yettuck - she who names the end at the beginning - she whose issue is Cyber-hype, 
    and is thus announced everywhere ... </p>
