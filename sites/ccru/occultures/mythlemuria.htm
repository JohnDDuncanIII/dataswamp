<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Puzzling 
    consistencies between rocks, fossils, and animal species found in South Asia 
    and Eastern Africa led 19th Century palaeontologists and geologists to postulate 
    a lost landmass that once connected the two now separated regions. This theory 
    was vigorously supported by E. H. Haeckel, who used it to explain the distribution 
    of Lemur-related species throughout Southern Africa, South and South-East 
    Asia. On this basis, the English Zoologist Phillip L Sclater named the hypothetical 
    continent Lemuria, or Land of the Lemurs. Lemurs are treated as relics, or 
    biological remainders of a hypothetical continent: living ghosts of a lost 
    world.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Haeckel's 
    theoretical investment in Lemuria, however, went much further than this. He 
    proposed that the invented continent was the probable cradle of the human 
    race, speculating that it provided a solution to the darwinian mystery of 
    the 'missing link' (the absence of immediately pre-human species from the 
    fossil record). For Haeckel, Lemuria was the original home of man, the 'true 
    Eden,' all traces of which had been submerged by its disappearance. He considered 
    the biological unity of the human species to have since been lost (disintegrating 
    into twelve distinct species). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a scientific 
    conjecture Lemuria has been buried by scientific progress. Not only have palaeontologists 
    largely dispelled the problem of the missing link through additional finds, 
    but the science of Plate Tectonics has also replaced the notion of 'sunken 
    continents' with that of continental drift. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'<i>When 
    the theory of continental drift was developed, people realized that it and 
    other more prosaic theories explained the distribution of animals, fossils, 
    and plants better then lost continents. As a result, Lemuria was allowed to 
    fade away into obscurity, while eclipsed by more realistic theories long before 
    there were GEOSAT and SEASAT satellite data to demonstrate the fictional nature 
    of Lemuria.</i> - [SPHINX group].</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now bypassed 
    by oecumenic rationality as a scientific fiction or an accidental myth, Lemuria 
    sinks into obscure depths once again.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    are two sub-orders of primates, the anthropoids (consisting of monkeys, apes, 
    and humans) and the prosimians, which include madagascan lemurs, asian lorises, 
    australian galgoes (or bushbabies), and the tarsiers of the Philippines and 
    Indonesia. The prosimians constitute a branch of evolution distinct from, 
    and older than, the anthropoids. Outside Madagascar, competition from the 
    anthropoids has driven all prosimians into a nocturnal mode of existence.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the 
    submergence of the Lemuria hypothesis, the presence of lemurs on Madagascar 
    becomes puzzling. Lemurs are only 55 million years old, whilst Madagascar 
    broke away African mainland 120 million years ago.<br>
    <br>
    Lemurs have also come to serve as icons of ecological tragedy. In 1987, World 
    Wildlife International declared lemurs to be the most seriously endangered 
    group of primates in the world.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 
    late 19th Century the conception of Lemuria was eagerly seized upon by occultists, 
    who - like their scientific cousins - wove it into elaborate evolutionary 
    and racial theories.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In <i>The 
    Secret Doctrine</i>, a commentary on the Atlantean <i>Book of Dzyan</i>, H.P. 
    Blavatsky describes Lemuria as the third in a succession of lost continents. 
    It is preceded by Polarea and Hyperborea, and followed by Atlantis (which 
    was built from a fragment of Western Lemuria). Atlantis immediately precedes 
    the modern world, and two further continents are still to come. According 
    to Theosophical orthodoxy, each such 'continent' is the geographical aspect 
    of a spiritual epoch, providing a home for the series of seven 'Root Races.' 
    The name of each lost continent is used ambiguously to designate both the 
    core territory of the dominant root race of that age, and also for the overall 
    distribution of terrestrial landmass during that period (in this latter respect 
    it can even be seen as consistent with continental drift, and thus as more 
    highly developed than the orginal scientifc conception). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">L. Sprague 
    de Camp describes Blavatsky's third root race, the &quot;ape-like, hermaphroditic 
    egg-laying Lemurians, some with four arms and some with an eye in the back 
    of their heads, whose downfall was caused by their discovery of sex&quot; 
    [LC:58]. There is broad concensus amongst occultists that the rear-eye of 
    the Lemurians persists vestigially as the human pineal gland. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W. Scott 
    Elliot adds that the Lemurians had &quot;huge feet, the heels of which stuck 
    out so far they could as easily walk backwards as forwards.&quot; According 
    to his account the Lemurians discovered sex during fourth sub-race, interbreeding 
    with beasts, and producing the great apes. This behavior disgusted the spiritual 
    Lhas who were supposed to incarnate into them, but now refused. The Venusians 
    volunteered to take the place of the Lhas, and also taught the Lemurians various 
    secrets (including those of metallurgy, weaving and agriculture). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rudolf 
    Steiner was also fascinated by the Lemurians, remarking that: &quot;This Root-Race 
    as a whole had not yet developed memory&quot; [AL:68]. The &quot;Lemurian 
    was a born magician&quot; [AL:73], whose body was less solid, plastic, and 
    'unsettled.'</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently 
    Lemuria has been increasingly merged into Churchward's lost pacific continent 
    of Mu, drifting steadily eastwards until even parts of modern California have 
    been assimilated to it. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    Blavatsky credits Sclater as the source for the name Lemuria, it cannot have 
    been lost upon her, or her fellow occultists, that Lemuria was a name for 
    the land of the dead, or the Western Lands. The word Lemur is derived from 
    Latin lemure, literally: shade of the dead. The Romans conceived the lemures 
    as vampire-ghosts, propitiated by a festival in May. In this vein, Eliphas 
    Levi writes of &quot;Larvae and lemures, shadowy images of bodies which have 
    lived and of those which have yet to come, issued from these vapours by myriads&#133;&quot; 
    [HM:126].</font></p>
