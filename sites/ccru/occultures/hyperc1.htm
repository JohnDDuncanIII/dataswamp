  <p><font color="#669933">Galactic Bureau of Investigations report to the Galactic 
    Federation on new sonic insurgencies.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">As we approach the Millennium, the Bureau has noted 
    a marked increase in the activities of the enigmatic group known as Hyper-C. 
    Agents will be aware that Hyper-C is a clandestine distributed network, dedicated 
    to &quot;aquatic return&quot; and the &quot;liquidation of Babylon&quot;. 
    Hyper-C is associated in particular with &quot;sonic intelligence weaponry&quot;, 
    and has taken credit for many recent examples of info-terrorism, which have 
    been conventionally but erroneously labeled as musical recordings. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Question: Who or what is behind the transmissions? 
    Is Hyper-C merely the name for a set of unco-ordinated but related practices? 
    Do Hyper-C activities amount to anything more than the replication of the 
    name Hyper-C?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">As with most threats the Federation currently faces, 
    Hyper-C has abandoned all traditional political methods and goals; it has 
    seceded utterly from the representational and signifying regimes of the Dominant 
    Operating System. Operatives should be warned that Hyper-C propagates virally. 
    It would be extremely foolish - and dangerous - to think of this as a metaphor. 
    Even the use of the term Hyper-C in this report is a spreading of the virus. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Warning: Agents must be aware that contact with Hyper-C 
    tends to dissolve all conventional sense of reality.The chief danger to Galactic 
    Federation operatives may be that agents begin to question the reality of 
    their mission; in many cases, operatives have been fooled into doubting the 
    existence of the Federation. A particularly nasty Hyper-C tactic involves 
    treating the Federation as Science Fiction. As one reputed Hyper-C signal 
    puts it.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><i>Everything you see, everything you hear; it might 
    be a mirage</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">A complementary diversionary tactic involves denying 
    the existence of Hyper-C itself. Do not be fooled: rumours and disinformation 
    are indispensable weapons in ultramodern cybernetic conflicts. Denying its 
    own existence is one of the ways Hyper-C spreads.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">In order to prepare agents for operating in the field, 
    it is necessary to describe some of the principal characteristics of Hyper-C 
    activities. These have been grouped under headings which have been taken from 
    Hyper-C communiques. On no account should operatives repeat these slogans; 
    they must be treated as highly contagious material.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><br>
    1. <i>From subversion to submersion</i>.<br>
    Agents should not assume that the absence of explicitly seditious signifying 
    material from Hyper-C transmissions indicates that they are devoid of content 
    or without effect. On the contrary: the fact that these transmissions in no 
    way resemble excepted modes of political address is indicative of their extreme 
    virulence. The &quot;disassembly of music into sonic machineries&quot; has 
    gone alongside the dissolution of politics into tactics. The aspirational 
    and representational logics of &quot;protest music&quot; have given way to 
    a technics of direct action, in which sound is used as a &quot;neuronic trigger.&quot; 
    Once again, agents should not imagine that there is anything metaphorical 
    about this. Hyper C sonic weaponry is stealthy but highly effective; it attacks 
    the organism very directly, opening up defensive membranes to an immersive 
    &quot;acoustic space.&quot; The abstraction of sound made possible by new 
    technologies enables a hitherto unimaginable distribution of &quot;the secret 
    coded rhythm patterns&quot; Hyper-C is dedicated to spreading. Operatives 
    should take special care with sonic strains labelled Wave-2 Detroit techno, 
    catajungle, 2-step, death garage, sinofuturism. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"> 2. <i>We will never surface</i>, or the sonic minorities 
    take to the shadows. <br>
    Hyper-C is said to model itself on the hunted animal, not the hunter. Hyper-C 
    accordingly make no attempt to infiltrate or occupy the mediascape, since, 
    as a previous GBI report has noted, Hyper-C now has &quot;global strike capacity 
    via Programmer digital communication systems.&quot; Instead of deploying these 
    digital communication systems to push a political program, Hyper-C is constantly 
    disappearing into a web of pirate communications and illicit marketization, 
    using the so-called Outernet to effectuate a &quot;virtual deletion of the 
    social.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">3. <i>Set your clocks to maritime</i>.<br>
    Hyper-C treats conventional chronology as &quot;fake time.&quot; It has developed 
    a sophisticated counter-chronic program, involving an anti-Gregorian Y2K positive 
    occupation of the so-called computer calendar, an engineered reversal of mammalian 
    evolution, and a mystico-materialist critique of sequential causality.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">4. <i>Negative Evolution</i>. <br>
    The attempt to escape &quot;fake time&quot; seems to take the form of &quot;spinal 
    regression&quot; the projected dispersal of mammalian organismic integrity 
    via a return down the evolutionary ladder. As a previous GBI report warns, 
    when negative evolution is achieved &quot;human characteristics begin to fade, 
    [and] the voice becomes unrecognizable.&quot; The recurrent reptilian and 
    fish imagery should not be interpreted as something merely symbolic. The Bureau 
    has every reason to believe that Hyper-C activists are pursuing all available 
    means to bring about a return to the &quot;icthiophidian flexomotile&quot; 
    spine. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">The Federation regards Hyper-C as one of the most serious 
    threats to the stability of the Ecumenon. These &quot;Aquassassins&quot; are 
    a Lemurian weapon aimed at Human Security, and it is a matter of urgency that 
    their activities be undermined &quot;by any means necessary&quot;. <br>
