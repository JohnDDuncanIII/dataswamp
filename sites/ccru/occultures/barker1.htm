  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#669933">Under 
    Pressure</font></b><font color="#669933">. Thomas Gold's model of The Deep 
    Hot Biosphere reallocates hydrocarbon deposits to an expanded anorganic chemistry 
    - derived from Supernovae debris, and accreted into planets from interstellar 
    dust-clouds - out of which everything flows bottom-up. Descent into the earth 
    leads out of the solar-system, in accordance with a xenoplutonic cosmic productivity, 
    transmitted through slow-release deep intra-terrestrial methane reservoirs, 
    pressure-stabilized against thermic dissociation. A vast mass of Archaean 
    microbes and submicrobial nanopopulations exploit this upwelling anorganic 
    hydrocarbon flow by scavenging loosely bound oxygen, reducing ferric iron 
    to magnetite ...</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Project-Scar</b>. 
    Southern Borneo, November 1980. Outside the monitoring hut a tropical storm 
    is slowly building. Irregular rain spatters heavily, rhythmically intermeshing 
    with type-taps and clicks. Barker hunches over the humming machines, lost 
    in theoretical trawlings through SETI-connected tick-talk tapes, unscrambling 
    cryptic dot-clusters and factor-strings into hints of alien contact. Xenotation 
    is clicking together, a mathematical antimemory where things meet. You could 
    easily think it was initiation, but it's all coming to an end, in scatter 
    tactics, particle streaks, and tachyonic transferences, drawing-out the twisted 
    trajectories of numerical disorganization ... and underneath - or between 
    - the implacable ticking of the time-missile ...</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Try to 
    figure it out and somewhere you cross over, which is problematic in various 
    ways. Unexpected difficulties infiltrate the calculations tick-systemic interchatter 
    implexes through plutonic torsion, a descent into the Outside.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When NASA 
    sees Barker's report, it flips - nonmetaphorically - into another phase. A 
    passage through institutional criticality occurs spontaneously, a conversion 
    of stack-tectonic torsion, triggering some kind of latent security-reflex, 
    or bureaucratically fabricated suppressor-instinct, extrapolating the exact 
    affective correlate of Anthropol. They were waiting for this. Waiting for 
    a long time.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The investigation 
    was disguised as psychiatric recoding, hidden even from itself. This was shortly 
    after the stuttering started, drifting in on a wave of body-tics, micro-spastic 
    tremors a multiplication of mixed signals chronometric tick-tock melting into 
    jungle noises clicks and chirps of the cicadas, insectoid chitterings, static, 
    take-up materials for tick-bite tinnitus intercut with rhythmic pattern virus, 
    a subsemiotic staccato of throat-scratching tick-chatter stitched into the 
    talk-sickness - calling demons.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It gets 
    confusing, the way tick-fictions take, or stick.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>They 
    said it was due to excessive pressure - much later, they told me this - These 
    were the facts, and the rest was fiction. Immediately after the break-down 
    I had been taken back to the States, to a medical installation. So everything 
    happened in America, and it all checked-out. There was no contact, no tick-disease, 
    no flight into the jungle. They were insistent about that</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barker 
    was born on the night of the dead. folded into the end from the beginning 
    sketched out. It's evident now, with his ID meticulously compiled, social 
    tag-numbers, educational and medical records, security clearance evaluations, 
    research checks, neurocartographic print-outs, psychometric data, conclusions 
    formatted for rapid scanning, with columns of tick-boxes</font></p>
  <p> <font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;What 
    do you make of these,' the doctor snorts derisively: 'You mean that nonsense 
    about a tick-borne infection. It was obviously made-up, tacked-on.'</i></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would 
    have been a cruel coincidence, if true, to be stricken by tick-bite sickness, 
    after everything that had been suggested, stigmatic residue of a flight into 
    the jungle - that never happened - but somehow it stuck, latching-on to mammal 
    heat, or the smell of blood.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tick 
    is a parasitic arachnid. It has been considered as an ethics-packet that climbs, 
    sticks, and sucks, functioning as a vector for numerous things, tack-ons, 
    stickers, hallucinations, tinnitus buzz-clicks, micro-sonic teemings, semi-sentient 
    flickering across the fever-scape, skin tracked by infected suck-marks that 
    snake along the veins. Tick-dots, <i>o</i></font><font color="#669933"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">r 
    IV punctures, according to them, from the sedatives and antipsychotics, all 
    accounted for in the medical logs, plus a tick-delirium tacked-on - because 
    there was no flight into the jungle - only high-frequency hallucinations of 
    parasitic micromultitudes, itching skin-swarms</font></i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With tick-systems 
    anything will do. Each intensive numerousness hatches onto another numerousness 
    of lower organicity, subcellular animations and subsemiotic tokens, high-pressure 
    chemistry, phasing down into nanomachining electron-traffic, magnetic anomalies, 
    and fictional particles. Ticks - which are never less than several - are anything 
    whatsoever, when caught by numerical propagations whose thresholds are descents, 
    and whose varieties depend upon the phase considered</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>They 
    seemed to think it was about arachno-bugs, biological taxonomy, and bite-signatures, 
    as if the tick-delirium was representing something. All that really mattered 
    were the numbers, which could have been anything. At first the machines became 
    erratic, it was an almost imperceptible electronic glitching, microvariations 
    of magnetic weather, rhythmic disturbances. Out in the jungle it was called 
    Ummnu, but that never happened ...</i></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing 
    happens to Barker except downwards - that's the catch, and the ticket - inverse 
    climbings of the heat-pressure gradient, escalations in intensity, time-crossings.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can 
    the end be already in the middle of the beginning? - as the problem is posed 
    in Pandemonium, whenever - in the outer-time of Ummnu - the cryptic ticking 
    of chthonic unclocks mark an incursion from beneath, or between. Down there 
    it is forever turning into itself, through the electromagnetic catatracts 
    of Cthelll, whose body-neutral metallic click-storms feel like sinking out 
    of chronicity.</font></p>

    surface chauvinism and solar parochialism: Vortical stickiness of the tick-matrix.</font></p>
