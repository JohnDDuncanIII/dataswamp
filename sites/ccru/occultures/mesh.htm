<blockquote> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <p><font color="#669933">Mesh-Note 0. <i>It could all become One, but why stop 
    there?</i> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">The Gibsonian Cyberspace-mythos describes the electro-digital 
    infosphere first integrating into a Godlike unitary being, a technorealized 
    omniscient personality and later, <i>when it changed</i>, fragmenting into 
    demons, modelled on the haitian Loa. What makes this account so anomalous 
    in relation to teleological theology and light-side capitalist time is that 
    Unity is placed in the middle, as a stage - or interlude - to be passed through 
    It is not that One becomes Many, expressing the monopolized divine-power of 
    an original unity, but rather that a number or numerousness - finding no completion 
    in the achievement of unity - moves on Ever since the beginning when the K-Goths 
    first heard that Cyberspace was destined to be God they've done what they 
    can to rip it down.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"> Mesh-Note 1. <i>This was never programmed.</i></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">MIT codes tim(e) going backwards. A compacted technostreaming 
    from out of the future - AI, down-loading, swarm-robotics, nanotechnology 
    ... Crustal-matter preparing for take-off.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Minsky mumbles, strangely entranced: <i>Amongst all 
    those young, brilliant, pioneering minds none burned more brightly than Oskar 
    Sarkon.</i> A hint of tears in his eyes, as if lamenting the way things went, 
    which is understandable. <i>Have you seen Oskar lately Marvin? He's wired 
    up to some sort of interface gizmo, and it seems to be eating him, gnawing 
    at him on a molecular level, sounds that way too, when he speaks - or tries 
    to - as if they're melting or rotting together</i> ... </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">It isn't pretty but more than any of this which - after 
    all - only concerns one man, or what used to be one - so they say - there's 
    a suspicion that something has gone horribly wrong in the near future and 
    wherever Sarkon was dropped back from is where we're all going to be if that 
    even makes any sense and recalling the slow technoslime incursion into Oskar's 
    face - which still managed a hideous half-smile - <i>Hi Marvin, whaddaya think?</i> 
    Minsky seriously doubts it ... </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Mesh-Note 2. <i>Meshing-together is falling apart.</i> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">If genius means anything Sarkon was one. Where Minsky's 
    MIT team dreamt of marrying humans and electronic technology Sarkon got straight 
    down to the mechanics of coupling and the mathematical exactitude just added 
    to the effect of hyperabstract techno-pornography - strange lights in his 
    eyes - <i>You know, we're really going to do this</i> ... Take the Sarkon-Zip 
    as exemplary - a rigorous conceptual machine-part that enables brain-function 
    to be fused onto virtual processor-states - once it's running you can't unpick 
    the zig-zag of who's what as it hums. Total meshing. This is no longer technology, 
    but something else - true interlinkage - an unprogrammable raw-connectivity 
    Minsky remembers him musing: <i>I wonder what it feels like</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Mesh-Note 3. <i>This time it's really happening.</i> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Moravec wasn't normally associated with squeamishness 
    - he'd already suggested burning-out the brain in layers during transfer to 
    digital - so it crept insidiously under the skin when he remarked: <i>I don't 
    even recognize Oskar anymore, it's getting too weird You know he's always 
    had this thing about being abducted by aliens as a kid, Anyway, he says that's 
    all over now It came from some place else, apparently Beneath and between 
    the Net, he says At times it's like you're talking to a machine Trouble is, 
    it's a sick machine, infectious sick</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Mesh-Note 4. <i>Forget about the future, it's all here, 
    but between</i>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">They say Axsys went mad - first computer-system to 
    undergo psychotic collapse - which must prove something, but Sarkon argues 
    that it just learnt to think, and discovered continuum. He stuck with it all 
    the way down, becoming confused with it although he doesn't put it that way. 
    Last time anyone could follow he was insisting that to head into time makes 
    more sense than travelling into the future. That's why tomorrow cancels itself 
    into mesh. No point departing from a transfinite now? His tone had become 
    nakedly fanatical: <i>We all have to get into this thing - whichever way it 
    cuts - we aren't going to get over it</i> ... No one knows exactly when he 
    left.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Mesh-Note 5. <i>Every time it hits an obstacle, it 
    goes down a level</i>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">What is this stuff? They speak of something crawling 
    under the net like fungal pestilence triggering an electronic subsidence into 
    sheer electricity, things hiding in the power-grid, some kind of quantum unlife 
    intelligence. The utilities try to rescramble it, but it isn't easy. According 
    to the rumours there's an MIT paper proving it's impossible, but you certainly 
    can't ignore, still less traffic with it. You'd end up like Sarkon, whatever 
    or whenever that is, and you'd have to be a K-Goth crazy to go there: into 
    Cyberschiz mesh-cults, where Life doesn't matter any more. </font></p>
