  <p><font color="#669933"><i>Can fiction become fact? It always does, when it's 
    hyperfiction. This special report takes us from the 1920s into the near future, 
    in a bid to track down the origins of a contemporary myth&#133;</i></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Some say that Miskatonic University is nothing more 
    than a rumour, or a joke. Yet rumours have an unsettling ability to make things 
    happen, and jokes, it is often said, have a serious side. My journey to the 
    semi-fictional Miskatonic Virtual University hasn't yielded much definite. 
    But perhaps that's the point&#133;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Starting with the most straightforward data, such as 
    it is. MVU dates back to the early 1970s, when the N.W. Peaslee Chair in Hydro-History 
    was created for Professor Echidna Stillwell. The &quot;University&quot; had 
    no campus as such (it still doesn't) - hence the &quot;Virtual&quot; of its 
    title - but was a loose agglomeration of scholars, most affiliated to other 
    institutions, especially MIT. (Miskatonic had been described as the &quot;Shadow 
    MIT.&quot;) What bound them together was a shared interest in the &quot;hyperfictional&quot; 
    aspects of the work of H.P. Lovecraft. MVU thus brings together experts in 
    fictional systems, mathematics, physics, geology, semiotics: all engaging 
    in strange, crossdisciplinary pollenations that, if they are not actively 
    forbidden, are unsupported in any other academic institution. The University 
    has only one rule; all of its meetings must take place in Lovecraft's beloved 
    state of Massachusetts.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">The story of MVU is inextricable from that of Echidna 
    Stillwell. Stillwell had done pioneering fieldwork in ethnology in the 1920s, 
    but her reputation quickly fell into eclipse. University authorities began 
    to fear that she had gone native, credulously and uncritically adopting the 
    strange folk beliefs of her beloved Mu N'Ma. Some went so far as to suggest 
    that she had been &quot;creative&quot; with her findings; that much of her 
    data had been simulated. Fearing that they had a Blavatsky-type fake on their 
    hands, the University moved to dissociate themselves from her work. A whispering 
    campaign was orchestrated , and Stillwell was first discredited and then &quot;forgotten&quot; 
    by an anthropological community increasingly keen to establish its scientific 
    credentials. The result was that her voluminous works - on Mu folklore - went 
    unpublished. Complete disreputability was assured when her work began to be 
    championed by occultists, poets and cranks of every persuasion.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">One of these champions was Captain Peter Vysparov. 
    But Vysparov was no lone obsessive or starry-eyed mystic. To all outward appearances, 
    he was a respectable army Captain, who had played a distinguished role in 
    the Special Operations Executive during World War II. Scratch the surface, 
    though, and a stranger, shadier picture begins to emerge.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Vysparov was a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, whose 
    family had fled to the USA during the Revolution. The Vysparovs were a reclusive 
    family, shrouded in rumour. Serf legend had it that they had acquired their 
    wealth through &quot;abominable magical pacts&quot;. And, sure enough, rumours 
    of occultism followed Peter Vysparov into World War II. Coincidentally, Vysparov 
    had been posted to the same theatre where Stillwell had done much of her fieldwork. 
    He worked with the Dibboma, the degraded rump of the Dib N'Ma, who were one 
    of the three original N'Ma tribes. It was said that Vysparov had employed 
    &quot;unorthodox&quot; means in his war against the Japanese, using Dibboma 
    sorcerers in a &quot;magical war&quot;. Since Vysparov's methods highly successful, 
    military High Command were not overly concerned to investigate them. And neither 
    was much anyone else. In 1947, an American journalist began to research the 
    story, but he was unable to substantiate anything before an untimely, yet 
    apparently accidental, death.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">It is only with the recent release of correspondence 
    between Vysparov and Stillwell that the events of the war - which throw a 
    great deal of light on the subsequent development of Miskatonic - have become 
    clearer. The provenance of this correspondence, it should be pointed out, 
    is still highly disputed. The Stillwell estate - notoriously and understandably 
    touchy - is reluctant to confirm the authenticity of the letters, while lawyers 
    acting for the Vysparov family made strenuous, but ultimately failed, efforts 
    to suppress the correspondence. Nevertheless, Dr Edward Blake, the author 
    of a forthcoming Stillwell biography, believes that the letters are genuine. 
    &quot;They bear many of Stillwell's characteristic stylistic traits, and all 
    the facts seem to square with the available data. If they're a fake, they're 
    an incredibly detailed one; I'd certainly like to meet someone with knowledge 
    of Professor Stillwell this precise!&quot;</font></p>
