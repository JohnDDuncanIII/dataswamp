  <p><b><font color="#669933">Captain Peter Vysparov to Dr Echidna Stillwell, 
    19th March 1949. </font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Dear Dr Stillwell,</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"> I have been fortunate enough to encounter your ethnographic 
    work on the Nma, which I have studied with very great interest. May I trouble 
    you with an account of my own, which might be of relevance to your researches. 
    During the recent Pacific conflict - (a peculiar oxymoron!) - I was deployed 
    covertly into the Dibboma area of Eastern Sumatra. My mission - which was 
    categorized under psychological operations - consisted basically of attempted 
    cultural manipulation, with the aim of triggering a local insurgency against 
    the Japanese occupation. I hope it will not distress you unduly if I confess 
    that your work was a crucial resource in this undertaking, which involved 
    intense - if patently exploitative - communication with dibboma witchcraft. 
    My only excuse is that hard times require moral hardness, and even obvious 
    cruelties, I was obeying orders, and accepted them as necessary. Beyond confirming 
    your own conclusions, these activities brought me into proximity with phenomena 
    for which I was cognitively ill-prepared. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">What began as a merely opportunistic usage of Dibboma 
    lore - conceived initially as native superstition - transmuted incrementally 
    into a sorcerous war against the enemy garrison. In just two weeks - between 
    March 15th - 29th 1944 - three consecutive Japanese commanders were incapacitated 
    by severe mental break-down. In each of these cases the process of deterioration 
    followed the same rapid course: from leadership dysfunction, through violent 
    assaults on subordinate personnel, to berserk derangement and paranoid ravings, 
    culminating in suicide. By the end of this period the order of the occupying 
    forces had entirely disintegrated. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">It would be dishonest of me to conceal the fact that 
    the Dibbomese paid a devastatingly heavy price for this success. On the basis 
    of this experience I cannot easily doubt that Dibboma sorcerors are in some 
    way able to telepathically communicate extreme conditions of psychotic dissociation. 
    It is with great reluctance that I accept such a radical hypothesis, but alternative 
    explanations, such as poisoning, disease, or coincidence stretch credibility 
    even further. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Yours, with sincere admiration, </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Captain Peter Vysparov </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">PS. I cannot help noticing that the dates concerned 
    - as also of this letter - are strangely Lovecraftian.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><b>Dr Echidna Stillwell to Captain Peter Vysparov, 
    23rd March 1949. [Abridged].</b> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Dear Captain Vysparov, </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Thank you for your frank letter of the 19th March. 
    I found it truly horrifying, and yet also fascinating. I appreciate that it 
    cannot have been easy to write. I shall not attempt to hide the great distress 
    your account caused me, adding as it does such a terrible episode to the modern 
    history of these cruelly afflicted people. Whilst already suspecting that 
    this ghastly war might have stricken the Nma yet further, it is crushing indeed 
    to have my darkest thoughts thus confirmed. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">I would be interested in learning more about the details 
    of Dib-Nma sorcerous practice before attempting to respond to your hypothesis. 
    Be assured that - after spending seven years amongst the Mu-Nma - I will not 
    hastily judge anything you communicate as wild or fanciful. As far as the 
    question of dates is concerned - which you indicate only elliptically - I 
    assume that you are referring to what in Northern latitudes constitutes the 
    Spring Equinoctial period - mid to later March - which is so emphatically 
    stressed in Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, and which also - coincidentally 
    - comprises the intense-zone of Nma time-ritual. This complicity has long 
    intrigued me. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">As I am sure you are aware, Lovecraft had a peculiar 
    obsession with the South-Seas, a thematic coalescence of almost hypnotic ethnographic 
    fascination with the most abysmal and primitive dread. I have attempted to 
    correspond with him about these issues, but found that this topic quickly 
    punctured his thin-crust of supercilious New-England rationalism, exposing 
    an undercurrent of heavily fetishized archaic terror mixed with extreme racial 
    paranoia. When he began referring to the rich and subtle culture of the Mu-Nma 
    as &quot;the repugnant cult of semi-human Dagonite savages&quot; I broke off 
    communication ... Despite this unfortunate argument, I consider Mr Lovecraft's 
    fictions to be documents of the greatest importance, and welcome the opportunity 
    to discuss them further. In addition, my own Neolemurian Hypothesis intersects 
    with his wider terrestrial and cosmic vision in a number of crucial respects, 
    particularly insofar as nonhuman cultural factors are seen to play a decisive 
    role in large-scale historical developments.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><b>Captain Peter Vysparov to Dr Echidna Stillwell, 
    3rd April 1949. [Extract] [Dear Dr Stillwell] </b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">I am afraid you are right to suspect that I have reserved 
    certain aspects of my engagement with Dibboma sorcery, perhaps from fear of 
    ridicule. What has so far been omitted from my sketch of telepathic psychosis 
    - which I will now relate - is the source pathos, so to speak, or - in the 
    words of the military officer I was then: the occult ammunition manufacture. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Not only did I learn of the Japanese command being 
    wrecked by psychological cataclysm - both by conventional and decidedly nonconventional 
    intelligence gathering processes - I was also witness to the assembly of the 
    weapon itself. I had then - and still have - no doubt at all that the madness 
    breaking out in the local Japanese headquarters was the very same thing that 
    I saw brewing-up like a dust-vortex in the Oddubbite trances of a Dibbomese 
    witch, who I came to see as my greatest tactical asset and most valued companion 
    (in that order, I confess). It was an experience of soul-carving horror for 
    me to witness this meticulously deliberated descent into the splintering of 
    self - complete personality disintegration - which she somehow traversed, 
    and which she called shattering the mirror of existence. I gathered that this 
    expression originally referred to the surface of still water, but since the 
    arrival of European colonists silvered mirrors have been highly treasured, 
    and their pulverization invested with immense ceremonial significance. Dibbomese 
    sorcery does not seem to be at all interested in judgements as to truth or 
    falsity. It appears rather to estimate in each case the potential to make 
    real, saying typically &quot;perhaps it can become so&quot; ...</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><b> Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov, 19th April 
    1949. [Extract] [Dear Captain Vysparov]</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Whilst respecting the candour of your account, I cannot 
    but abominate the necessity that has led the Nma and their sorcerous abilities 
    to be conceived and utilized as mere munitions in a conflict imposed upon 
    them from without. From what I can reconstruct from your description it seems 
    to mark a degeneration of Nma demonism and time-sorcery into mere magic, or 
    the imposition of change in accordance with will, in this case the will in 
    question being the overall policy and strategic goals of the US war-effort, 
    microcosmically represented by your own - evidently gallant, competent, and 
    persuasive - military office. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Forgive my lack of patriotic ardour, but it strikes 
    me as an appalling indication of cultural decay and corrosive nihilism when 
    a Dib-Nma witch allows herself to be employed as a crude assassin, however 
    one evaluates the cause thus served. This is all a matter of deepest regret, 
    although not - to my way of thinking - of individual culpability. As the Mu-Nma 
    say in their bleakest moments: <i>nove eshil zo raka</i> &quot;Time is in 
    love with her own pain.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Your discussion of Oddubb-trance makes no mention of 
    temporal anomaly. This surprizes me. The Mu had immense respect for those 
    Dibba witches who they described as returning from the Oddubb-time to come, 
    and the Mu-Nagwi or dream-witches often claimed to meet these back-travellers 
    in the Vault of Murmurs, where they would learn about future times. They said, 
    however, that this time is compressing, and soon ends, although I had not 
    imagined the end to be so imminent. Remembering this omen returns me to abysmal 
    melancholy, consoled only by another Mu-Nma saying: <i>lemu ta novu meh novu 
    nove</i> &quot;Lemuria does not pass as time passes.&quot; I shall try to 
    think things thus. As you say - with the Dibbomese - <i>shleth hud dopesh</i> 
    &quot;perhaps it can become so&quot;</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <font color="#669933"><b>Peter Vysparov to Echidna Stillwell, 7th May 1949. 
    [Extract]</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">Here in Massachusettes we have been convening a small 
    Lovecraft reading-group, dedicated to exploring the intersection between the 
    Nma cultural constellation, Cthulhoid contagion, and twisted time-systems. 
    We are interested in fiction only insofar as it is simultaneously hyperstition 
    - a term we have coined for semiotic productions that make themselves real 
    - cryptic communications from the Old Ones, signalling return: <i>shleth hud 
    dopesh</i>. This is the ambivalence - or loop - of Cthulhu-fiction: who writes, 
    and who is written? It seems to us that the fabled Necronomicon - sorcerous 
    counter-text to the Book of Life - is of this kind, and furthermore, that 
    your recovery of the Lemurodigital Pandemonium Matrix accesses it at its hypersource. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">I hope it is superfluous to add that any directly participative 
    involvement on your part would be most extravagantly appreciated.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#669933"><b>Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov, 28th May 1949. 
    [Extract] </b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">It is with some trepidation that I congratulate you 
    on the inauguration of your Cthulhu Club, if I may call it such. Whilst not 
    in any way accusing you of frivolity, I feel bound to state the obvious warning: 
    Cthulhu is not to be approached lightly. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">My researches have led me to associate this Chthonian 
    entity with the deep terrestrial intelligence inherent in the electromagnetic 
    cauldron of the inner earth, in all of its intense reality, raw potentiality, 
    and danger. According to the Nma she is the plane of Unlife, a veritable Cthelll 
    - who is trapped under the sea only according to a certain limited perspective 
    - and those who set out to traffick with her do so with the very greatest 
    respect and caution. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933">That her submerged Pacific city of R'lyeh is linked 
    to a lemuro-muvian culture-strain seems most probable, but the assumption 
    that she was ever a surface-dweller in a sense we would straightforwardly 
    understand can only be an absurd misconstrual. It is much more likely that 
    Cthulhu's rising - like that of Kundalini as it was once understood - is a 
    drawing down and under, a restoration of contact with abysmal intensities. 
    Why would Cthulhu ever surface? She does not need rescuing, for she has her 
    own line of escape, trajected through profundity. Much of this relates to 
    the occult teachings of the sub-chakras in zones of Indo- Lemurian influence.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933"> Hyperstition strikes me as a most intriguing coinage. 
    We thought we were making it up, but all the time the Nma were telling us 
    what to write - and through them ...</font></p>
