<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Tale </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day, on their way 
    North, three travellers encounter a frog-monster. Before it can block their 
    path, the first traveller rushes past and disappears into a raging snow storm.<br>
    <br>
    Enraged by this manoeuvre the frog-monster seizes the other two.<br>
    &quot;This is my road,&quot; it croaks &quot;and if you want to go any further 
    it will cost you each a sack full of worms.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;O great and slimy 
    beast,&quot; replies the second traveller respectfully. &quot;the land is 
    frozen, the earth is hard as iron, and worms are hard to find.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Then you should seek them amongst the dead,&quot; counters the frog-monster 
    implacably.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two travellers set 
    off on their long search. After much wandering, and many adventures, they 
    arrive at last at fabled Tchukululok, the City of the Worms, where they are 
    greeted by the dead. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They explain their plight, 
    and beg their ancestors for worms. <br>
    &quot;The worms are our treasure,&quot; the dead answer cunningly &quot;they 
    are all that remain to us. How can you expect us to give them away for nothing? 
    But do not despair. There is a game of chance we value highly. If you remain 
    here and play with us a while perhaps you can win them honestly.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second traveller is 
    appalled. <br>
    &quot;It is evil to play amongst the dead,&quot; he declares. &quot;I should 
    rather abandon my journey altogether.&quot; Saying this he returns to the 
    South, and never sees the frog-monster again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third traveller is 
    not so easily dissuaded. <br>
    He agrees to the bargain, and sits down to play. <br>
    Luck is with him.<br>
    After many games his sack is full of worms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But just as he is about 
    to leave he notices a familiar figure amongst the throng of gamblers.<br>
    It is his missing friend, the first traveller.<br>
    &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asks, shocked and perplexed. <br>
    &quot;No sooner had we parted than I was caught in a terrible storm&quot; 
    his dead companion replies. &quot;Since then this city has become my home,&quot; 
    he continues sadly. &quot;Now you have won what you need and must leave me 
    here to sleep with the worms, and to dream of gaming with those that still 
    live.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third traveller returns 
    to the Frog Monster to give him the worms he has won. The creature smiles 
    hideously and beckons him onwards. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up ahead an annihilating 
    blizzard is howling. It sounds as if all the dead of Tchukululok were calling 
    him to his fate. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">Redneck 
    Version</font></strong> (Overheard in a Black Lake bar).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>You call it the Black 
    Lake Legend and it sounds kind of grand. I call it your typical Tookie crap 
    and that&#8217;s nearer the reality of the thing. Judge for yourself. I dunno 
    about this singin&#8217; and dancin&#8217; thing they&#8217;re doin&#8217; 
    at the casino, but the story&#8217;s simple enough anyhow. Starts with a bunch 
    of Tookies travelling, just travelling, you understand. All their stories 
    take that for granted, they&#8217;re always about journeys going nowhere in 
    particular, unless things go wrong, and it turns out they&#8217;re going somewhere 
    really bad. You can ask me about the Tookie problem &#8216;round here and 
    I&#8217;ll tell you just as clear as you like: the Tookie problem is your 
    average fucken Tookie. Main thing being that they ain&#8217;t got no sense 
    of destination, that&#8217;s why nothing ever comes of anything they do. It&#8217;s 
    a kind of stubborn meaninglessness at the heart of what they are. They ain&#8217;t 
    going nowhere and they never were, that&#8217;s the simple fucken truth of 
    the matter. Anyhow there&#8217;s these wandering Tookies and they walk slap 
    bang into the devil, although it wasn&#8217;t the devil, not exackly, but 
    it must&#8217;ve seemed like it to them because it got in the way of their 
    going nowhere - if you follow me - danger being that they might end up somewhere, 
    arrive, and there ain&#8217;t nothing for them so bad as that. So this devil-creecha 
    won&#8217;t let them pass unless they rob the dead - you see we ain&#8217;t 
    exackly in bible territory here - so first you&#8217;ve got your bumming around, 
    then comes the stealing, now I&#8217;d expeck they&#8217;d all get drunked-up 
    a bit at this point, but that ain&#8217;t in the story as I heard it, instead 
    they set up a gambling pit and during the course of some hoodoo card-sharping 
    shit with the dead win everything they need to pay off the creecha and head-off 
    nowhere. Now you can call that a legend if you want mister, but in my book 
    anything that starts off going nowhere and ends up going nowhere ain&#8217;t 
    saying nothing worth hearing.</em></font></p>
