<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    facts surrounding the death of controversial Anglican minister Martin Bergmann, 
    in Hammersmith, west London, last week, continue to be mysterious. Speculation 
    as to the events leading up to Bergmann's untimely death at the age of 39 
    is still rife, with murder, suicide and death by misadventure all possibilities.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Police 
    have so far refused to comment, saying that &quot;investigations are in progress&quot;, 
    but others have not been slow in coming forward. Claiming that &quot;there 
    are many who would want him dead&quot;, supporters and friends &#150; all 
    of whom declined to be named &#150; said that Bergmann's death was part of 
    an international conspiracy of mind-boggling complexity, in which P2, the 
    enigmatic Vatican lodge rumoured to be behind the controversial death of Pope 
    John Paul I, is supposedly central. But members of the Church of England's 
    General Synod have moved to crush what they have called &quot;these tasteless 
    and irresponsible rumours&quot;, putting Bergmann's death down to the &quot;final 
    act of a deeply troubled mind, now, it is to be hoped, at peace at last.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The confusion 
    surrounding Bergmann's final hours is all of a piece with the rest of his 
    life. Reliable facts about Bergmann are few and far between. The often viciously 
    partisan positions his extreme views have invoked meant that Bergmann was 
    always surrounded by a fog of often ill-founded rumours, a situation exacerbated 
    by his refusal to communicate with the media. Like one of his mentors, the 
    Danish religious philosopher Kierkegaard, Bergmann professed a deep hatred 
    of the press; a contempt extending beyond mere refusal to co-operate into 
    occasional examples of outright violence. One &#150; notorious &#150; incident 
    last year, in which a photographer threatened a legal case for assault, was 
    ultimately settled out of court.<br>
    <br>
    The &quot;dark nordic prince&quot; arrived in England under a cloud a decade 
    ago, hounded out of his native Norway for leading a rogue Protestant sect 
    whose practices and beliefs, according to one Norwegian churchman at the time, 
    were &quot;unspeakable and wholly unacceptable.&quot; (&quot;Only the C of 
    E would welcome you with a CV like that,&quot; a senior Church of England 
    official remarked recently.) Some say that Bergmann &quot;cynically and wantonly&quot; 
    exploited the ailing Church of England's renowned tolerance &quot;to a parodic 
    degree&quot;, using Church protection to disseminate beliefs &quot;in every 
    way contrary to established Christian doctrine.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fond of 
    quoting Kierkegaard's dictum, &quot;Christianity is what Christ came to abolish&quot;, 
    Bergmann developed what he called an &quot;anti-Christian Gnostic Christianity&quot;. 
    He characterised established Christianity as &quot;the cult of Paul&quot; 
    and decried church buildings as &quot;prisons for God.&quot; Drawing upon 
    Gnosticism, he argued that the &quot;Creator entity&quot; &#150; the Judaic 
    Christian God &#150; was a &quot;blind idiot god suffering from autism&quot;; 
    all creation &#150; and organic life in particular &#150; were to be regarded 
    as &quot;foul excresences we must seek to annul or to escape&quot;. But it 
    was his persistent vilifications of the Roman Catholic Church that proved 
    the greatest source of embarrassment to the Church of England hierarchy, whose 
    declining congregations are one factor impelling an increasingly strong ecumenical 
    drive towards convergence with Rome. The vociferousness of his anti-Catholicism 
    was taken by some to be indicative of failing mental health (&quot;he was 
    totally gone&quot;, one former friend said yesterday). Bergmann, however, 
    claimed that &quot;the only rational view of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; 
    was that it was &quot;a monstrous blasphemy of transcendent evil: incomparably 
    more corrupt than the Mafia (if indeed it can be separated from organised 
    crime, which of course it cannot)&quot;. His views, he said, were backed up 
    by &quot;hard sociological data which even they can't suppress now&quot; concerning 
    the &#150; apparently endemic &#150; problem of institutionalised child abuse 
    amongst Catholic clergy. But Bergmann alienated any of the few supporters 
    he had even within Protestantism by adding that &quot;any religion that is 
    serious about worshipping the Father-God will always be about child abuse; 
    the only difference between the religion of the Paulites and that of the Abrahamites 
    is that, in the Paulites' case, child torture spills over into child murder. 
    Despite tying and binding Isaac, the Jewish God ultimately spares Abraham's 
    son; but the Paulite God actually kills his own son.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presenting 
    a &quot;Spinozist immanent critique&quot; of Calvin, Bergmann argued that 
    &quot;the Calvinists' biggest mistake was that they were insufficiently fatalistic. 
    Evidently, fatalism and morality do not mix. They confused an ethical and 
    transcendental injunction &#150; if you eat the apple you will be ill &#150; 
    with a moral command &#150; do not eat the apple.&quot; The &quot;specific 
    and unique&quot; contribution that Protestantism had to make had been &quot;systematically 
    distorted into a dismal work-cult,&quot; Bergmann argued, &quot;by a set of 
    State-loving, self-serving money-grubbers.&quot; Bergmann's well-known detestation 
    of consumer culture was based around an adherence to what he called the &quot;category 
    of the sufficient&quot; which had been &quot;annihilated&quot; by a capitalism 
    &quot;insisting you gorge yourself on more and more things you don't want.&quot; 
    Bergmann argued that &quot;aseticism and self-denial are not moral positions 
    but very specific programs for the systematic dismantling of secular identity, 
    ways of opening up the body to the Utter Nothingness which is the reality 
    of the true God.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unsubstantiated 
    rumours suggest that the Church's tolerance of Bergmann was not due solely 
    or even primarily to the C of E's well-known spinelessness, but to his reputed 
    competence in the ostensibly discontinued practice of exorcism, a subject 
    about which the Church has been consistently evasive. But even Bergmann's 
    purported expertise here had a bizzare twist, since his technique as an exorcist 
    was supposedly based on &quot;co-operating with demons&quot; in an attempt 
    to &quot;free them&quot; from &quot;mammal meat.&quot; All of which prompted 
    an exasperated High Church spokesman to remark that, &quot;Surely even a Church 
    as notoriously liberal as ours must abominate priests who openly sympathise 
    with demons, and who make no bones about their hatred of God.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    are those who claim that Bergmann had &quot;never abandoned the harsh and 
    pitiless pantheon of dark gods&quot; from his &quot;ancient Norse heritage.&quot; 
    But friends suggest that the &quot;rot really set in&quot; when he began to 
    take seriously the works of the late Science Fiction writer Philip K. Dick. 
    &quot;Dick's sanity was questionable at the end,&quot; the Reverend Colin 
    Wemmick, an erstwhile associate of Bergmann's points out. &quot;But Martin 
    had become convinced that Dick's [Gnostic-influenced] conviction that the 
    Roman Empire had not ended was a vindication of his own views of an unbroken 
    continuity of Roman power.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to his opponents, the discovery of Bergmann's body &#150; masked, and trussed 
    with various kinds of harnesses - &quot;make a mockery&quot; of his theories 
    of &quot;anti-sexuality&quot; which argued that &quot;sexuality&quot; was 
    &quot;a secular hell people voluntarily enter; a meat prison for the body.&quot; 
    Others claim that the scene of Bergmann's death was &quot;obviously faked 
    by his enemies &#150; of which he had many.&quot; Yet the most intriguing 
    suggestion comes from those closest to Bergmann, who indignantly insist that, 
    far from being some secret sexual perversion, the apparatus Bergmann had assembled 
    was part of a regime of &quot;systematic anti-sexual practice&quot; (&quot;he 
    was building a machine to escape the meat&quot;). A series of unpublished 
    writings on Masoch which reputedly argue that &quot;the properly religious 
    attitude is always deeply masochistic,&quot; and which extol Masoch &quot;as 
    a profoundly religious thinker,&quot; apparently confirm this interpretation.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#669933" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In death 
    as in life, little is certain about Martin Bergmann. Reverend Wemmick probably 
    summed up the situation best when he said, &quot;when you look into Martin's 
    life, you open up a can of worms &#150; a writhing mass of confusion.&quot; 
    Those worms are likely to writhe for some time yet.<br>
