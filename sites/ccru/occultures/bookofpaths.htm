<p> <strong><font color="#70A038" size="4">Editor’s Introduction</font></strong> 
<p> <font color="#70A038">The Kaye Materials, which came into the possession of 
  the Ccru in late January 2000 (shortly after William Kaye’s untimely death), 
  contain several mentions of The Book of Paths, referring to it on one occasion 
  as: “the definitive confirmation of Stillwell’s basic insight”. Yet despite 
  extensive investigation, the Ccru’s attempts to access this text were consistently 
  frustrated. All inquiry into the book was suspended due to a complete lack of 
  productive leads. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> In 2003 the Ccru undertook an intensive investigation 
  into Kaye’s cryptic references to documented interconnections between William 
  Burroughs, Peter Vysparov and Lemurian time travel. During the course of this 
  research the Ccru entered into correspondence with the Vysparov estate, inquiring 
  into the contents of the Vysparov Library, where Kaye had spent many years working 
  as an archivist and cataloguing director. The notorious library of the Vysparov 
  family is reputed to contain one of the world’s greatest collections of occult 
  works. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> During the final stages of the research project, the 
  Ccru received a package from the estate containing a photocopied document which, 
  although untitled, proved upon careful inspection to be nothing less than the 
  complete text of The Book of Paths. Appended to this document was a single page 
  (also photocopied) of a handwritten letter from Chaim Horowitz to Peter Vysparov, 
  dated February 1949. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> It is this text which is reproduced here. On the basis 
  of Horowitz’s letter it can be confidently identified as the so-called ‘B Manuscript’ 
  of The Book of Paths, one of three type-copies of Horowitz’s first English translation 
  from the Tibetan. As far as the Ccru is aware, this is the first time that The 
  Book of Paths has been made publicly available in any language. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> <strong><font size="4">The Letter</font></strong> <br>
  Dear Peter, </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Here at last is a complete translation of the Old Book. 
  Having entrusted this package to Echidna’s safekeeping1, I am assuming it has 
  reached you undisturbed. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> The translation has taken me over a year. Perhaps inevitably, 
  some difficult choices had to be made. It goes without saying that I have placed 
  the strictest priority on the preservation of systematic coherence. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> There is no need to remind you that the special circumstances 
  attending the discovery of this text necessitate the very greatest discretion. 
  I extracted a copy from ‘the place’ with considerable trouble, but of that let 
  us converse on another occasion.2 </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Although I only had a brief opportunity to discuss the 
  work with Echidna, she had many interesting points to make -- as always. In 
  particular she has been able to find some tantalizing traces of its history 
  within Chinese sources dating back to the Warring States period, when it was 
  already considered profoundly archaic, with more than one ‘dark school’ even 
  suggesting that it preceded the I Ching. It seems that by the early Tang it 
  was considered to have been erased from the earth, one of the yaoshu or ‘devilish 
  books’ destroyed utterly in Chin Shi Huang Di’s great burning. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Echidna herself thinks there are indications it was 
  already serving as an oracle for the mysterious culture of the Shu Kingdom, 
  5,000 years ago. She has stumbled upon persistent rumours that a series of 84 
  bronze tablets were inexplicably removed from the Shu excavation site by figures 
  described variously as ‘looters’ or ‘senior officials’. </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> We are both hopeful that Mme C. will be able to cast 
  light on the oracular dimension of the work - in truth this has eluded us both 
  so far, despite the most strenuous efforts.3 </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> I am sure you will agree that these pages, inelegantly 
  produced though they may be, will add inestimable riches to your family’s peerless 
  collection of esoteria. Perhaps even more importantly, we are both confident 
  it will prove itself profoundly relevant to your work on the ‘Pandemonium System’.4 
  </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Your invitation was received with great enthusiasm - 
  if at all possible we shall meet in the fall.5 </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Yours with heartfelt regards, </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> Chaim </font> 
<p><font color="#70A038"> 1. Horowitz met the esteemed Lemurologist Echidna Stillwell 
  in Rangoon during the early spring of 1949. <br>
  2. ‘The Place’ clearly designates the source of the Mu Archives, where Horowitz 
  conducted research throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s. William Kaye believed 
  that it was located in a concealed sub-basement of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. 
  <br>
  3. ‘Mme C.’ almost certainly refers to Zelda Maria de Monterre, better known 
  as Madame Centauri. During this period Madame Centauri was working as a ‘celestial 
  consultant’ or fortune teller in New York. <br>
  4. As of now (May 2004) Ccru has not been able to determine whether any such 
  ‘profound relevance’ was in fact discovered. <br>
  5. There can be little doubt that the ‘invitation’ concerned the inaugural meeting 
  of the Cthulhu Club, scheduled for the fall of 1949. </font>
