  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>One: 
    Seduction </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">What is 
    seduction? What is it to be seduced? It is not to be outwitted, deceived or 
    overpowered; there has to be complicity. One does not seduce; it's always 
    a question of two, of the duo and the duel. Never a simple matter of domination, 
    whatever the seducer may think. &quot;Doesn't the seducer end up losing himself 
    in the strategy, as in an emotional labyrinth? Doesn't he invent that strategy 
    in order to lose himself in it? And he who believes himself the game's master, 
    isn't he the first victim of strategy's tragic myth?&quot; (98) <br>
    And isn't that what happens to Baudrillard? .....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Seduction 
    (the book) emerges as a turning point in Baudrillard's career. Whilst engaging 
    with the themes established in his work up until Symbolic Exchange and Death 
    (which immediately preceded it), Seduction marks a decisive advance by taking 
    seriously - which is to say, frivolously, ironically - the possibility of 
    practising critique beyond the strictures of academic theory. It is a book 
    that no longer pretends to be a secondary commentary or a straightforward 
    description of the empirical, but which presents itself as a challenge - diabolical, 
    clever, playful - to what it identifies as the hegemony of the political and 
    its heavy Spirit of Gravity. Seduction marks the move from a still- ostensibly 
    academic &quot;sociology&quot; to a fully fledged theory-fiction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">As a strategy 
    invented to consume the elements by which it was first constituted, the text 
    constantly evades itself, setting up mobilisations and effects beyond those 
    which it intends to describe. It is a text which sometimes loses itself in 
    the Process; like any body caught in the throes of passion, it occasionally 
    inhibits itself from the power to act or to think. Seduction, then, is itself 
    a seduction &quot;...a mode of circulation that is itself secretive and ritualistic, 
    a sort of immediate initiation that plays by its own rules...&quot;(81), an 
    attempt to lure theory away from what Baudrillard thinks has seduced it: the 
    political, significatory and libidinal economies of depth and meaning. &quot;[S]eduction's 
    enchantment puts an end to all libidinal economies, and every sexual or psychological 
    contract, replacing them with a dizzying spiral of responses and counter-responses...&quot; 
    (83) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard's 
    earlier work was an attempt to extend and develop into contemporary social 
    theory the Mauss-Bataille critique of &quot;bourgeois utility&quot; . His 
    ostensible animus is always Anthropol: politics, rationalist anthropology 
    and psycho-logos, the key players in a contemporary mythology of the subject 
    and its pathologies that, Baudrillard thinks, is a Core Master Class projection. 
    Far from being the teleological endpoint of history, the subject and its privatized 
    unconscious, are, Baudrillard claims, the expression of capital's systemic 
    interiority, as embodied in the law of equivalence. Exteriority is located 
    way back - in the aboriginal socius and its practices of potlach and kula 
    (symbolic exchange), and at the limit points of the social and the psychological, 
    where white-man face subjectivity is voided, in death. Baudrillard thus develops 
    what is in effect a reverse anthropology, in which a simulated-primitive gaze 
    observes the mean rituals of civilization, comparing the dull, white magic 
    of Oedipus with the shamanistic frenzy of symbolic exchange. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">If symbolic 
    exchange has largely disappeared from Seduction's vocabulary, it's because, 
    by now, the concept of seduction has absorbed its role as the embodiment of 
    Baudrillard's beloved principle of ambivalence. Seduction emerges as an alternative, 
    not only to the reality principle, but also to what Baudrillard sees as its 
    doubles in machinic materialism and feminism: the concepts of production, 
    Desire and power, all of which merely hold up a mirror to bourgeois utility, 
    a mirror, moreover, which reflects a stage of capitalism that is now superseded: 
    the industrial. This is &quot;second-order simulacra&quot;, an order, Baudrillard 
    explains in the essay &quot;Simulacra and Science Fiction&quot; - written 
    almost contemporaneously with Seduction - that is &quot;productivist, founded 
    on energy, force, its materialization by the machine and the whole system 
    of production - a Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, 
    of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the utopias related 
    to this order of simulacra).&quot; (SS 121) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard's 
    thinly-veiled attack on Deleuze-Guattari here goes hand in hand with his critiques 
    in Seduction of becoming and the nomadic (directed against Deleuze's Logic 
    of Sense, but also making a pre-emptive strike against A Thousand Plateaus). 
    But no-one is spared: Seduction also makes peremptory dismissals of Irigaray 
    and Foucault. All are seen as continuing what he characterises, in his essay 
    &quot;On Nihilism&quot;, as the essentially &quot;nineteenth century revolution&quot; 
    of &quot;the destruction of appearances&quot;, a project that, thanks to capital, 
    has long since been achieved, paving the way for a &quot;postmodern&quot; 
    stage dedicated to &quot;the destruction of meaning&quot;, (SS 160-161), a 
    stage commensurate with a systemically self-compensating cybernetic capitalism 
    that is not only immune to the old tactics of the political; it functionally 
    requires them as its motor of innovation. The system cannot be challenged 
    by radical indifference to meaning, value or limits in general; it anticipates 
    mockery and is thus well stocked with recuperative counter strategies. How, 
    after all, can nihilism continue to exist in a system which condones it, radicalises 
    it to such an extent that it becomes unsustainable? It reverts, neutralises, 
    disappears in the Process, predictively producing simulations of its own redoubling, 
    reversible limits. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Deleuze-Guattari, 
    Irigaray and Foucault are, Baudrillard says, still duped by the political 
    and its assumption that there is something behind or beneath appearances waiting 
    to be liberated. Thus feminism, for instance, becomes complicit in the order 
    of power, when previously it &quot;mastered&quot; the order of the symbolic, 
    the realm of appearances where, according to Baudrillard, anything that matters 
    really happens. Baudrillard's position is not motivated by epistemological 
    concerns, as is often thought: it is not that he thinks there is no external 
    reality ( he is not interested in such facile neo-Cartesian debates, which, 
    anyway, belong at the level of first-order simulacra); it is that he thinks 
    reality is fundamentally ambivalent, fatal, and given over to the artificial. 
    In other words, it is already, he wants to say, &quot;feminine&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>Two: 
    The Horror of Nothing to See</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The elision 
    between the feminine and the female that runs through Seduction means that 
    in the end, Baudrillard doesn't need actual women. The accoutrements are enough; 
    the make-up and make-believe that is more than fantasy but less than a matter 
    beyond his control. Seduction wants things covered up; starting with the female 
    body, which, following Barthes on Striptease, it thinks is &quot;desexualised 
    at the very moment when .. stripped naked&quot; (M 84). So instead of pursuing 
    a futile quest to possess what he thinks he has unveiled, Baudrillard develops 
    a reassuring ache for what he knows he can never have. Like the customers 
    of Gibson's high-tech prostitutes, the meat puppets, he wants &quot;to have 
    it both ways&quot; (BC 220), feeling &quot;torn between needing someone and 
    wanting to be alone at the same time, which has probably always been the name 
    of that particular game ...&quot; (BC 220) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">But the 
    game he wants to play is a question of semiotics, not carnality. He wants 
    to be alone with his signs, affecting disdain for her body, needing it only 
    as a clothes-horse. I'll dress you up, make you up, he says to her: you'll 
    be my ideal but you, you have the real power because you know you are not 
    as you appear to be. The blinding coverings of cosmetics and projected make-believe 
    provide the assurance of the masculine and also the allure of the unrealised 
    power of the feminine. &quot;The masculine is certain, the feminine is insoluble.&quot; 
    (11) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Get too 
    close and this whole scene disappears. Terrified of the threat posed by a 
    &quot;[n]earmess so pronounced that it makes all discrimination of identity 
    ... impossible&quot; (TS 31), Baudrillard keeps his distance. Like all real 
    Casanovas, he's bored by consummation, adopting what he sees as a tasteful 
    restraint when it comes to bodily fluids (dim the lights, you can guess the 
    rest). Always preferring the thrill of the chase, he's turned off by too much 
    technical detail. He calls this predilection for the unflattering epidermal 
    blow-up, for extreme proximity to female body parts, obscene. It is a phenomenon 
    which extends beyond sexuality, beyond pornography. Any way, pornography, 
    he says, has little to do with &quot;sex&quot; but is part of drive towards 
    a perfect, high fidelity, high resolution realism (&quot;Stereo-Porno&quot;) 
    (28-36). Pursued to its limits, this drive for &quot;perfect realism&quot; 
    brings specular male Desire into an impasse that Baudrillard encounters in 
    the &quot;Japanese vaginal cyclorama.&quot; He describes the scene: &quot;Prostitutes, 
    their thighs open, sitting on the edge of a platform, Japanese workers in 
    their shirt-sleeves ..., permitted to shove their noses up to their eyeballs 
    within the woman's vagina in order to see better, but what?&quot; (31) Baudrillard 
    is fascinated, but ultimately repelled, perplexed; since, for him, &quot;... 
    her sexual organ represents the horror of nothing to see. ...A 'hole' in its 
    scoptophilic lens.&quot; (TS 26) Why look into it? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">He asks, 
    because not only does he think he's seen everything there is to see, he thinks 
    that if it cannot be seen, it must be nothing: a zero that is still the zero 
    of castration, that must - knowingly, cynically, sentimentally - be covered 
    up. Let's pretend, he urges, fog up the lens a little, forget ourselves.that 
    if it cannot be seen, it must be nothing: a zero that is still the zero of 
    castration, that must - knowingly, cynically, sentimentally - be covered up. 
    Let's pretend, he urges, fog up the lens a little, forget ourselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In looking 
    and seeing nothing, he is content to know that all that he seeks is neatly 
    concealed within a box - finite and belonging to the past. However, the contents 
    were never secreted from his eyes only - his visual system was never the intended 
    arbiter of perceptibility. Indeed his short-sightedness was to her advantage. 
    His demands that women perform the rituals of seduction as webs of appearances 
    allowed the rules of camouflage to be written. Baudrillard's challenge does 
    not, after all, prove to be a tall order. He may think he fills the gaps, 
    his voids with the technics of seduction, but such holes will always elude 
    themselves. When she is not appearing, she is signalling - to herself even. 
    She is keeping the breaks in the circuit open, for when the crucial moment 
    arrives. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The secret 
    which Baudrillard knows he cannot see can helpfully maintain his status quo. 
    However the secret that he does not know that he cannot see, due to blindness 
    beyond the visual and a lack of perceptual experimentation, takes the signs 
    of his appearances and turns them against themselves, converting the modes 
    of meaning and non-meaning into passwords, true names and female signals which 
    proliferate without syntax and semantic. By converting simulation into Process, 
    they will produce a different set of effects commanded by their capacity to 
    effectuate and not by their capacity to mean. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">For as 
    long as Baudrillard refuses to experiment with his hands, to develop orientation 
    skills dependent on the malleable, proximate, tactile, contiguous, he will 
    not be responsive, or even able to register a set of communication procedures 
    which will always continue without him. He will fail to see that apparently 
    finite contents are in fact infinite forms, and even then of a highly specific 
    kind. Well defined contents traced by relative positions and defined perspectives 
    can also behave in the most nebulous of fashions - de-localising themselves, 
    constructing fine and diffuse webs of escape. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">For as 
    long as he thinks that he was the only One worth concealing the secret for, 
    he will continue to see no other explanation for Processes which are not simply 
    about the play of appearances, than that of 'anatomy is destiny'; the explanation 
    handed to him in the first place. Those who will not play him at a game for 
    which he, at least in the beginning, set the rules, will therefore be doomed 
    to mechanisms of containment in which they have already become familiar - 
    those of the constructionist/ essentialist debate. Baudrillard likes things 
    in containers. There is after all a place for everything. If she will not 
    play with the appearances which he can see, she will be swiftly returned to 
    where she will be seen - to the harsh and floodlit zone of assumed female 
    essentialism. To where he can keep an eye on you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>Three: 
    Closed Circuits (the Mirror of Psychoanalysis)</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard's 
    indifference to the female body also blinds him to the specificities of his 
    own. Or rather, seduction as he describes it becomes a way of dealing with 
    the tristesses of a male libidinal economy that won't move &quot;beyond erection 
    and decline. Beyond high and low, and their hollows and abysses.&quot; (ML 
    37) To compensate for what happens after coming he defers contact, perpetually 
    if possible. This economy, concealed in the act of looking, finds itself reflected 
    everywhere. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">&quot;I'll 
    be your mirror,&quot; he says, &quot;reflect what you are/ in case you don't 
    know.&quot; Which also means that, inevitably, everything will reflect what 
    he is. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">&quot;Seduction/ 
    simulacrum: communication as a functioning of the social in a closed circuit, 
    where signs dupilcate an undiscoverable reality.&quot; (163) Baudrillard's 
    circuitires are tightly sealed, cannot be transcended, dialectically negated 
    or apathetically challenged. They simply implode continuously, drawing information 
    into black, involuting holes and releasing none in response, producing gaps 
    in the Process which Baudrillard hastily fills with seduction before something 
    far less identifiable creeps in. All contingencies are strategically prepared 
    for in advance, reality is diagnosis, predestination is rife. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Doors 
    with known other sides, boxes with finite secrets; these coquettish flirtations 
    with the Outside are soon recuperated, &quot;...as the functioning of the 
    social within a closed circuit, where signs duplicate an undiscoverable reality&quot; 
    (163). Baudrillard knows that there exists sensation which he cannot accommodate 
    for as long as his body is sealed from the openings which he has not yet found. 
    Yet these intrusions are the counters of another game for which he does not 
    know the rules for as long as they are constituted by what he disparagingly 
    calls carnal or physical Desire. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">From the 
    other side of the mirror, Irigaray often poses a question: how has the woman 
    found herself within the confines of his obsessive, self reflecting motions, 
    with no apparent point of entry in what is clearly a circular argument? She 
    has always been attuned to the detection of a sealed loop - to the observable 
    tendency of a protectionist system &quot;...to turn eternally in its own orbit, 
    forever to return to the same point in the circle where it would always already 
    have been placed in order to keep every system in order, including, paradoxically, 
    its own...&quot; (S267) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Although 
    Baudrillard often gestured towards it, the final dissolution of the subject 
    and the object into the circuit is always blocked. 'The feminine' operates 
    as the circuit-breaker: still the object of process that, although ostensibly 
    interminable (&quot;without terms&quot;, as the later Baudrillard would have 
    it) perpetually back-projects man as subject. For Baudrillard, &quot;as long 
    as there is seduction, there must be a subject to be seduced. And this subject 
    is masculine, as Baudrillard is quick to admit and happy to assume, while 
    that which seduces is its 'missing dimension', the feminine.&quot; (ES 90) 
    So that's who he is. She says: &quot;You want me to confirm you endlessly 
    in your own form so that you can lose yourself over and over again...&quot; 
    (ML 56) Her function is always &quot;to deliver the male to himself,&quot; 
    (SG 115) to turn the supposedly open game into a closed system of self-reference, 
    indexed to a (male) subject asserted even as it affectssurrender itself in 
    supine bliss-out. He wants to watch himself disappear. Forever. Fatal strategies: 
    homeopathic doses of self-cancelling annihilation. &quot;My death is everywhere, 
    my death dreams.&quot; (SymD 158) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard's 
    insistence that seduction should never be the result of hysterical attraction 
    or the conjunction of affect is a clever strategy which will ensure that his 
    cards are kept firmly to his chest. With his inherent blindness to the unpredictability 
    of his environment, many of her moves will apparently abide by his coarse 
    and overlaid categories, but for those which refuse to make sense and fail 
    to announce their intended non-meaning he has constructed another category, 
    &quot;...the void - the hole that, at any point, is burned out by the return 
    of of the flame of any sign, the meaningless that makes the seduction's unexpected 
    charm - (it) also lies in wait...&quot; (84) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In Seduction, 
    Baudrillard's earlier dances with death become a flirtation with this void, 
    a not-quite fatal fascination with the complete white-out of subjectivity. 
    It is a long familiar tactic which saves him from the trouble of goal posts 
    which move on their own - it is a means of charting territory; for if it should 
    run out, at least he knew the terror of the dark interior long in advance 
    of his arrival. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">So, covering 
    up the dissolution into pure Process (the Absolute as Not One, haptic blizzard 
    of imperceptible contiguities), Baudrillard still has &quot;to believe in 
    'objects' that are solidly determined ... accepting the silent work of death 
    as a condition for remaining indefectibly 'subject'.&quot; (TS 115) His deep 
    commitment is to a tragic cybernetics of equilibrium, whose limits he invests 
    in as a fatal strategic check to the purportedly boundless energetics of &quot;Promethean&quot; 
    man. Yet Baudrillard's model of systemic compensation, object revenge and 
    the accursed share - his favoured strategy of reversal - always keeps him 
    within the terms of what he is critiquing, remaining at the level of passive 
    nihilist mockery rather than ever effectuating active nihilist anti-oedipal 
    practice (the first and second positive tasks of schizoanalysis are effectively 
    coterminous, Deleuze-Guattari point out, you can't destroy Oedipus without 
    at the same time creating relations with the Outside). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard 
    is aware of this critique, but responds by targeting its producers. &quot;New 
    diagonals of meaning, new sequences can be engendered from the untamed flood 
    tides of Desire - as in certain philosophies, the molecular or intensive philosophies, 
    which claim to undermine meaning by diffraction, hooks-ups and the Brownian 
    movements of Desire.&quot; ( 138) &quot;At One moment I truly wanted to write 
    a kind of Mirror of Desire as there had been the Mirror of Production ... 
    &quot; (BL 58) But in spite of himself - or because of his self - it's still 
    the mirror of psychoanalysis that Baudrillard presents. Without Desire, what 
    is seduction but a perverse reflection of the three psychoanalytic principles: 
    &quot;Pleasure, Death and Reality&quot;? (TP 154) Like the psychoanalysts, 
    Baudrillard entertains the possibility of an erotics &quot;not subordinated 
    to procreation, or even to genitality&quot;, but also like them, he &quot;retained 
    the essentials&quot; (TP 155): the &quot;principle of constancy&quot; (TS 
    114), appearing not now as pleasure or death but as ambivalence and reversal, 
    the equivalent of a reality principle whose mode of regulation has become 
    the ironic and the tragic. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In the 
    end, though, the familiar tracking of a circuit around pre-set points can 
    only be accomplished by a uniformity in speed and the attached constancy in 
    pressure. It is to a woman's advantage that the revolution of a cycle is soon 
    proximate to a spin, for then it may take on a life of its own, gathering 
    the momentum which Baudrillard stifled with mere thoughts of seduction. &quot;Speculation 
    whirls round faster and faster as it pierces, bores, drills into a volume 
    that is supposed to be solid still.&quot; (S 238) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>Four: 
    Openings</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Yet what 
    of seduction itself? For as a Process it is far in excess of it writings. 
    For Irigaray, these circles which constantly return to the point at which 
    they first began are not what they appear. For the female zero, vulva, circle 
    never finally closes up in the shape of a ring. Consequently, her nothing 
    is in fact his everything. Indeed, the severance of the suppression must surely 
    be evidence of the magnitude of her posed threat. As she waits, fills, reflects 
    his image, she is concocting the mannerisms of a different seduction - that 
    which extends beyond the stakes of Baudrillard's flutter. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">He &quot;watched 
    zeros pile behind a meaningless figure on the monitor...&quot; (BC 217) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Ultimately 
    Baudrillard is coaxed into the circuitries which proliferate beyond those 
    in which he himself is looped - for they have always set him a challenge which 
    he cannot, in the end (as he predicted) fail to take on. He had foreknowledge 
    of his destiny: &quot;And he who believes himself the game's master, isn't 
    he the first victim of the strategy's tragic myth?&quot; - and yet, for a 
    while, he persists in resisting. He is, of course, too late - like any tragic 
    figure, he has become more and more embroiled in his fated destiny exactly 
    as a result of trying to avoid it. Life is just a lottery. Like any real Casanova 
    he has fallen for her tricks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Baudrillard 
    rightly announces that the 'cycle of seduction cannot be stopped' and he momentarily 
    acknowledges the full, corrosive implications of this Process; &quot;There 
    is no active or passive mode in seduction, no subject or object, no interior 
    or exterior: seduction plays on both sides, and there is no frontier separating 
    them...&quot; (81). Yet when faced with the possibility that reality itself 
    may become seduction, that Process may take over previously identifiable parts, 
    he withdraws the circumference of his circuit in order to ensure that the 
    system's energy requirements will be sufficiently low; that it will sustain 
    itself without a connection to the Outside. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Fearful 
    and fascinated, Baudrillard always postulated that the object would take revenge 
    by refusing to be a useful thing - affecting a certain relish at the prospect. 
    But then the object was only One of her many faces - faces &quot;already scattered 
    into x number of places, that are never gathered together into anything she 
    knows of herself... &quot; (S 227) This incompleteness, this ability to continually 
    become something else whilst stalling his every attempt to consider her univocally 
    nothing, is her state of &quot;cyclical discontinuity&quot;. (S 230) As the 
    imperceptible source of renewal, the neglected sustenance of Baudrillard's 
    gaming fancies, the cleavage or pause in the cycle, she occupies zones of 
    intensity. The parts of the cycle, menstrual or otherwise, which are not necessarily 
    committed to the reproduction of the One. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">It is 
    no wonder that Baudrillard can refuse to notice because the momentary gaps 
    in the cycle, the withdrawals of extension before activity can begin again 
    are synchronised to the gauges of a different space-time - one in which her 
    patient waiting and measured retreats &quot;would open the interval of a future 
    and become swollen with the inhibited energy in a cumulative process of retention; 
    in this way the secondary chronological order would be constituted....&quot; 
    (LE 219) The object turned female may well beat Baudrillard at his own game 
    but she has no interest in returning to the beginning for a second round; 
    she will treat the debris of his failed strategies not as waste to be picked 
    over but as disposables discarded on the way elsewhere, to where new movements 
    and rhythms can emerge instantaneously before polarisation can set in once 
    again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Taken 
    beyond Baudrillard then, isn't seduction always a matter of programmes which 
    exceed their instructions, of unlocatable women...of Desire? In the end, Baudrillard's 
    dismissal of Desire is found wanting. If Baudrillard constantly snipes at 
    Deleuze-Guattari, it's because he has been hoodwinked by their camouflage. 
    Yet they have used a technique whose operations he has himself described at 
    length: simulation. Anti-Oedipus simulates the terms of 60s Desirevolution 
    and Marxism in order to take them beyond themselves, just as Irigaray simulates 
    the terms of essentialist feminism for similar purposes. In both cases, Baudrillard 
    is taken in by appearances, confusing a complex fluid dynamics with a naive 
    celebration of the aleatory that he can easily dismiss: &quot;...the idea 
    that the world of things is subjected to a molecular and objective disorder 
    - the same disorder that is idealised and glorified in the molecular vision 
    of Desire - this assumption is insane.&quot; (146) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">&quot;It 
    is not from some libidinal investment, some energy of desire that th[e seductive] 
    passion acquires its intensity, but from gaming as pure form and form purely 
    as formal bluffing.&quot; (82) Indeed; but only when it is captured, turned 
    against itself, does Desire invest. Just as Baudrillard wants, Desire plays, 
    games. And the matrix or plane of consistency is a grid on which Things hatch; 
    &quot;defined by axes and vectors, gradients and thresholds&quot;, it is a 
    &quot;row of doors&quot;, not a &quot;homogeneous surface&quot; (TP 508) Desire, 
    as Deleuze-Guattari repeatedly insist, is never an undifferentiated libidinal 
    flux waiting to be set free, just as production is not the production &quot;of&quot; 
    an object. Fundamentally, desiring-production describes the reverse: the deconstitution 
    of objects into Process. Schizoanalytic Desire does not seek release: it is 
    tension-in- itself, cybernetic poise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">And so 
    is seduction, once it is delivered from Baudrillard's subjecitivist reterritorializations. 
    The challenge is set, but never by pre-defined contract - it will set its 
    own tasks, issued consecutively by tauntings and coaxings to which One cannot 
    help but respond; &quot;why does one respond to challenge? The same mysterious 
    question as: what is it seduce?&quot; (S 82) Always really a matter of desubjectified 
    complicity, a type of compensation that isn't equilibrial, but which produces 
    &quot;continuous regions of intensity constituted in such a wayexternal termination, 
    any more than they allow themselves to build towards a climax...&quot; (TP 
    158), seduction is inevitably a question of Cyberotics. It must really be 
    an open game, with immanent rules, where &quot;the slightest caress may be 
    as strong as an orgasm&quot; (TP 156) . Instead of being a &quot;game&quot; 
    that &quot;ceaselessly ... bring[s] the outside inward&quot; (ML 12) seduction 
    would then become a &quot;field of immanence [that] is not internal to the 
    self, but neither does it come from an external self or a nonself. Rather, 
    it is the absolute Outside that knows no Selves because interior and exterior 
    are equally part of an immanence in which they have fused.&quot; (TP 156) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">&quot;Only 
    rituals abolish meaning,&quot; (158) Baudrillard insists. Yes, but beginning 
    with the equation the Real= the artificial, it is Desire that is always producing 
    rituals, &quot;manners of being or modalities as produced intensities, vibrations, 
    breaths, Numbers.&quot; (TP 158) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Similarly, 
    Irigraray mimics his rules for the purpose of removing him from the debate. 
    Boxes can be seen to contain secrets even when the contents escaped long ago 
    and found their way to the future. This is the beauty of the play of appearances. 
    Just as such escapades need methods of decipherment, methods of simulation 
    which act as One thing and then do another, they also require particularly 
    adept bodies - bodies of which Baudrillard, with his dislike of the tactile 
    and his fear of the carnal, cannot possibly conceive. These bodies are not 
    cosmetic for the purpose of appearance and play, nor are they invested in 
    the destiny of sexual organs, even though, as Baudrillard himself acknowledges, 
    these are already many more complicated than the One. Instead, they build 
    decoys, blatant falsities, process alternate signalling systems and convert 
    their every surface into zones of eroticism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>Five: 
    What can a Female Body do?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">All of 
    this Baudrillard misses. Now, when a crass blatancy of specular male sex is 
    proliferating across the screens of contemporary culture, Baudrillard's lament 
    that &quot;the sexual has triumphed over seduction&quot; (41) has a certain 
    power. But having identified, in Symbolic Exchange and Death , the phallus 
    as &quot;general equivalent&quot; for all specular representations of the 
    body, (SymD 101-4) Baudrillard cannot see that to evade phallic tyranny would 
    demand abandoning his empire of signs, the only level at which the phallus 
    can ever achieve domination. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Continuity 
    demands that Baudrillard recognise It has always been the Matrix - &quot;nonstratified, 
    unformed, intense matter ... fusionability as infinite zero&quot; (TP 153, 
    158) - yet he doesn't want to know, even if sometimes he is drawn out here, 
    positing, outside Seduction, an eroticism decoupled from reproductive sex, 
    (SymD 158) and &quot;a body without organs and the pleasures of organs&quot; 
    (SS 111). But in the end, he is always drawn back to the signs. Bataille, 
    he complains, in Symbolic Exchange and Death, is &quot;too biologistic&quot; 
    (SymD 158), just as Irigaray is censured, in Seduction, for supposedly reviving 
    the Freudian formula, Anatomy is Destiny. (9) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">But it 
    is never a matter of that. Far from it: Destiny, the judgments of God, has 
    traditionally decreed the somatization of the female body into idealist specularizations. 
    In the end, it is Baudrillard whose neuromances depend upon a certain biologism, 
    since even his semiotics are built upon a meiotic reproduction for which they 
    simulate disdain. Irigaray's delicate probings, meanwhile, make theory responsive 
    to a body that is only just opening up. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">It is 
    rarely asked what a body can do. Even less has been inquired of the capabilities 
    of an already rampant and stirred female body. It is almost too much to entertain 
    the possibilities of cosmic activity within the five to seven days of an exposed 
    menstrual cycle or of the unresolved sensations of a female Desire unconnected 
    to the production of issue. But the ceremonial subsuming of Baudrillard beneath 
    the flows of his own escaping system suggest that these questions can only 
    be answered, not in theory alone, but in an experimental practice, a Cyberotics 
    whose program is the transformation of unfeeling perceptual-conscious crust 
    into sensitive sampling tissue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Though 
    he would be the last to recognise it, there is a Desire named Baudrillard; 
    it is something a little like masochism in its fascination with pacts, rules, 
    artificial constraints, in its recognition that &quot;Pleasure is ... something 
    that must be delayed as long as possible because it interrupts the positive 
    process&quot; (TP 155): any way, it seeks out plateaus. Baudrillard himself 
    articulated the pointlessness of assuming final causes, of games that, to 
    the disappointment of the participants, would find an apparent end and need 
    to be started again. The games he prefers go on forever and cannot be confined 
    to chosen social bodies. Their resources and playing fields are non-localised 
    and responsive to virtually any element which crosses their path. Such universal 
    gaming makes impossible the explanation of social behaviour in terms functional 
    or teleological. If means are taken to occur without a view to their ends 
    then like any unfinished job, sex must be taken to occur without a view to 
    reproduction. In Seduction, Baudrillard unleashed activities of which he may 
    still remain unaware - open systems which never close, women who never reach 
    his chosen ends, woman who will never await his lingering gaze. Preferring, 
    instead, to stay in, switching themselves on, running auto-affection. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">And when 
    Irigaray invokes female-to-female Desire in &quot;When our Lips Speak Together&quot;, 
    this cannot be simply dismissed as a call for female separatism. Rather, by 
    defining Desire as the flatlands where the body with organ cannot go, she 
    radically inverts the phallic stupidity of molar sexuality's puzzled interrogation: 
    &quot;What do lesbians do?&quot; This is not a matter of keeping men out, 
    but of demanding of them that they become something else, that they lose the 
    pleasure of the organ in order to find a Desire that can never belong to them, 
    or to any One. essentialism which Baudrillard holds against Irigaray - as 
    if woman could be isolatable as an abstract quality to which she must aspire 
    and then maintain - with a wanting man following shortly behind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Yet its 
    practice is a continuous operation, never resolved, never frozen for long 
    enough for such identifiable abstraction to take place. Irigaray's woman, 
    always the tactful mimic, is able to mobilise the female stereotype to the 
    point where it may spin back in a white man face - to where it escapes the 
    socius in which it presently functions in order to re-infiltrate, on an as 
    yet uncharted trajectory via a non-identitarian zone of potential. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In a body 
    in which a womb is free to wander, Desire need be committed to neither sex 
    nor pleasure. She will instead invent a new erotics no longer confined to 
    the bed or the marital home. Her supposed essential identity finds no place 
    to reside in a body refusing definition by its form, its function or organs. 
    It becomes an estranged object like any other piece of debris from a molar 
    socius, detached from a body creative and productive, from a body both unfixed 
    and unknown since it refuses to remain stable across time. The potential cannot 
    be predicted because it is only partially observable amidst the ongoing interactions 
    which occur between the body and the environment which constitutes it. The 
    essentialist allegations against becoming woman are thus immediately allayed 
    - for inherent to the Process is an absolute dependence on specific conditions. 
    There is therefore no essential female beyond the circumstances which act 
    upon her. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">There 
    are sex organs more than those of One but there are also erogenous zones that 
    are not &quot;sexual&quot; - terrains of the body in which an eroticism decoupled 
    from issue can grow. This is a distributive female body, committed in entirety 
    neither to pleasure, procreation or means with an end; a body graded according 
    to the assimilation of broken particles. Neither essentially female (its resources 
    are far more than that of a recognisable woman) nor about the play of signs. 
    A glitch in the system, a break in the circuit, an exemplary volume without 
    contour. No wonder Deleuze-Guattari were so confused; &quot;There are women, 
    on the other hand, who tell everything, sometimes in appalling technical detail, 
    but one knows no more at the end than at the beginning: they have hidden everything 
    by celerity, by limpidity.&quot; (TP 288) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Infinite
