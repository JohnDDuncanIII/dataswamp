  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><i>AD 2003, 
    February 15, 15:30. Krueger's Bodymod Parlour, Los Angeles</i>. Jim Krueger 
    (or a rough approximation) is scrubbing dried blood off the third-hand Sony 
    neurotronics deck that functions as an improvised operating table. He is forty 
    years old but looks much older: large frame, badly chiselled features, with 
    a reddish-blond fascist-torturer crew-cut. His eyes are a frozen grey (the 
    left pupil no longer contracts). Krueger deals in semi-intelligent tattoos, 
    telecommunicative piercings, and junk-shop technocosmetics which teeter on 
    the scalpel-edge of legality, catering to K-Gothic neosavage aesthetics as 
    it bleeds across into data-pin piercings and skintelligence-scavenging. His 
    own hideous cranial scarring leads to endless jokes about bargain body-parts 
    and the cutting-edge of computing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">For the 
    most part, Krueger's occupation involves grafting electrotechnic slivers into 
    the heads of teenage girls.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You play 
    as Zeta Kane (she's your carrier): one of Krueger's regular customers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You can 
    snoop through the piles of cybernetic junk to familiarize yourself with Zeta's 
    sensory-motor skills. There isn't much room for acrobatics.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Try to 
    head-kick Krueger and he says &quot;Hey! I'm trying to work here.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">When you 
    get bored with that you can take Zeta through her previous implants (they 
    are listed in the biomechanics menu). She comes pre-equipped with multi-mode 
    synthetic eyes, acoustic enhancers, retractable polymetallic talons (with 
    toxic-loading option), biostatus monitor (or flatline deviation chip), and 
    various data-processing-pins.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You're 
    here for Zeta's latest upgrade. Climb onto the surgery couch and Krueger grafts 
    a BLC-699 onto her left temple. The specifications describe it as a Black 
    Lake Cognitech 699 Series Neuroelectronically-Interactive Subcutaneous Nanoprocessing 
    Graft. 512 Gbyte RAM, polychronic (up to 6 Ghz). Massively-parallel anarchitecture, 
    with 64 Tbyte wet-memory. Axsys Maze-Maker 1.3 pre-installed. On the box it 
    says: Take thinking out of your head (and onto your skin). Within K-Goth spirals 
    the Black-Lake connection adds massive subway-credibility.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Krueger 
    throws in a type-45 Pandemonium Chip for free (&quot;It came with the batch 
    - no idea what it does ...&quot;). The wafer-casing is marked with what might 
    be the figure of a snake, or the letter 'S,' or the numeral '5.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">On automatic, 
    you use your new graft to electronically trawl the Black Lake Technical Institute, 
    searching for materials related to the already legendary Dr Oskar Sarkon. 
    You access various files linked to Connexus, micropause research, neuroelectronically 
    'soft' drugs, and whatever other interface abnormalities haemorrhage out into 
    the flatline-fugues of A-Death. Something goes badly wrong (inevitably). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The screen

    starts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You're 
    obstructed by a police-cordon. Apparently there's been some kind of catastrophe. 
    You have to infiltrate past the cops. A web-accessed satellite-map of the 
    Black Lake area suggests that the only unguarded incursion route is through 
    woods. It turns out that these are infested by fierce dog-things that you 
    won't understand until later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><b>Level 
    1. Black Lake Technical Institute</b>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">At the 
    end of a hellish rain-lashed track a large dark building looms into view: 
    a ramshackle, turreted, neo-Gothic mansion, whose hideous gargoyles are starkly 
    delineated by intermittent flashes of sheet-lightning. 
    A sign above the half-open door reads: Black-Lake Technical Institute. All 
    the lights are out. You switch to night vision, and cross the threshold.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">At first 
    there are no signs of inhabitants. Even in the artificial half-light the grandeur 
    of the entrance hall is striking, despite the wreckage and signs of hurried 
    abandonment. You pick your way through the mixed debris of shattered glass, 
    and broken furniture. The walls are stained with ominous splashmarks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Near the 
    door stands a marble statue, portraying a heavily whiskered figure in heroic 
    pose. A bronze plaque on the plinth is engraved with the words: Boris Vysparov, 
    Knight of Reason,1874-1919. At the far end of the hall a spiral staircase 
    winds upwards into oblivion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">A computer 
    monitor flickers on the reception desk. Closer examination reveals it to be 
    a BLTI-Intranet terminal, giving you access to various files which you can 
    copy and load into Zeta's skintelligence graft. They include a map of the 
    Technical Institute, indicating the location and electronic status of the 
    library, laboratories, offices, and seminar rooms. Once installed, Zeta can 
    use Mazemaker to navigate BLTI infospace as a digital labyrinth.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The Mazemaker 
    interface expresses the detailed virtual maze-plane of skincrawler cyberspace 
    in the Axsys-Oecumenic consistent aesthetic. Its sleek corporate liquid-mercury 
    styling suggests a frictionless futurity. The burnt chrome semi-mirrorized 
    surfaces of its shafts and corridors dizzyingly reflect metamorphic icon-objects 
    and ubiquitous holographic advertizing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Zeta disturbs 
    this smoothly humming infocapitalist milieu with her Mazemaker carrier (named 
    Qwerka): a disorientatingly nonanthropomorphic infonaut-body, which shape-shifts 
    neo-totemically between shadowy bat-bird and tentacled manta-snake as it swims 
    through the glistening maze-ducts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Much of 
    the Maze-mapped BLTI-space is blocked,restricted, or partially obscured by 
    electronic Shroud encryption. It is densely haunted: populated by traps, AI 
    security drones, and various ambivalent soft agencies which Zeta needs to 
    deactivate, trick, subvert, or bypass. In addition, the physical door-locking 
    systems can often be circumnavigated in Mazemaker, encouraging an amphibious 
    zig-zagging between twin-labyrinths, each of which is a system of passages, 
    gates, and guardians.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As you 
    comb through the rooms, corridors, and stairwells you begin to encounter hostile 
    monsters - some humanoid, some not - but all exhibiting similar trance-like 
    behavior, intercut with extraordinary aggression. 
    If they take you by surprise things can get very ugly, so caution becomes 
    a necessity, and that slows you down. Bullets kill them, but it will usually 
    take several. It becomes important to watch your ammo supply, and your biostatus. 
    (You always have your talons to fall back on). If you notice the way they 
    move you might begin to suspect that there are such things as worm-zombies. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As she 
    fights her way across the game-space Zeta scavenges through laboratories, 
    storerooms, data-vaults, and corpses for soft and hard implant upgrades to 
    improve her capabilities, adding exotic optical options, alien senses, synthetic 
    claws and fangs, metabolic hyperloops, and skintelligence boosters. Weapons, 
    medicine, and information tend to melt together into augmentable cyborgian 
    competences.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Scattered 
    throughout the institute are numerous records of Sarkon's fertile involvement 
    in the Axsys-interface development, micropause research, and cognitech innovations 
    that had carried BLTI to the forefront of Neurotronics. The data-archiving 
    codes suggest that this work has been coordinated by a local AI-system called 
    Logo. A variety of topographic clues converge upon an attic area designated 
    'SPO.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The special 
    projects office occupies a turret-room. Zeta has to fight her way past three 
    particularly ferocious vermozombies to enter. It is obvious that whatever 
    happened here contributed catastrophically to the Black Lake outbreak.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">A figure 
    (who must surely be Sarkon) slumps against the Logo-link decks, neurosurgically 
    patched into the processing array through bundles of fibres. His head is twisted 
    back at a horrible angle, the shaven scalp etched by a cybergothic cross-hatching 
    of implant scars, socket-tabs, and cabling injuries. His skin is grey and 
    feverishly clammy. The eyes glaze-out unseeingly across sub-digital void. 
    At first his body seems to be locked rigid by connexus-catatonia, but as you 
    approach you notice that the oral region is quivering almost imperceptibly, 
    as if muttering strings of digits in an improvised phonetic code. Clutched 
    in his hand is a one page print-out.</font></p>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Recent 
    technical results suggest that Micropause can be considered a synative function, 
    modelling what amount to a numerically-controlled 'artificial-death.' In consequence, 
    it exhibits extreme sensitivity to the modulations of associated systems. 
    There seems to be no way in which such an entity could spontaneously generate 
    inside our systems. Could Shady Heights have introduced some complex factor 
    that has begun operating infectiously, perhaps even triggering consistent 
    parasitic behavior of the 'hyperworm' type?</font></i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Scrawled 
    jaggedly across the sheet in purple felt-tip are the words: <i>WHAT HAS GRUEBER

    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Zeta's 
    own cautious diagnosis excavates a set of data which indicates that either 
    Logo was climbing out of its control shell, or it was being taken-over by 
    something from outside. Psychotic AIs always looks like alien invasions. Sarkon 
    must have been trying to re-attach Logo-tags to the escaped systems, in order 
    to persuade the syndrome to identify with a Logo-fix. He had been sufficiently 
    desperate to crank directly into the Logo-core through cranial-leads, and 
    was now cutting diagonally down through software-strata, towards the infintely 
    desolated plane of absolute neurotronic fusion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">There's 
    nothing more for you to find here. It's time to check out Shady Heights.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You exit 
    the Technical Institute and access the Black Lake street map. The town has 
    been deserted by its human inhabitants. Anything still wandering around - 
    even if it's wearing a police uniform - is probably a worm zombie.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Upon a 
    pine-shaded ridge at the Northern limit of the town squats the menacing red-brick 
    bulk of the old Victorian reformatory, converted in the 1960's into Shady 
    Heights Secure Hospital (for the criminally insane). The edifice is soul crushingly 
    ugly, massive, and forbidding, its thick battlemented walls surrounded by 
    spiked railings and slitted by narrow windows reinforced by iron grilles. 
    Its atmosphere of grim desolation is ripped apart by the continuous jarring 
    wail of a security alarm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The main 
    gate - bristling with motion sensors and surveillance cameras - is electronically 
    sealed. When Zeta inputs the entry code (217) it slides open smoothly. You 
    creep inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><b>Level 
    2. Shady Heights</b>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The layout 
    of the hospital follows a broadly panoptic design. One thing is immediately 
    clear: if there was an attempt at an orderly evacuation it was a spectacular 
    failure. The interior has been redecorated in the crimson hues of frenzied 
    carnage. The hideously mutilated corpses of guards and prisoners lie in tangled 
    heaps in the open cells and ransacked offices, amongst scattered files, and 
    smashed CCTV equipment. On the wall of the main corridor are the words <i>MEDISYN 
    = MAD AS SIN</i> daubed thickly in blood. As Zeta prowls stealthily through 
    chaotic wards rank with paranoid schizophrenia and ancient secrets, muffled 
    moans, shrieks, and sinister laughter drift up out of the mouldering depths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Maxim - 
    an advanced Shroud AI - controls the hospital's automated maximum-security 
    system: a formidable interlocking network of electronically controlled surveillance 
    devices and physical barriers, designed to prevent escapes by an inmate population 
    numbering amongst its own some of the most terrifying psychokillers on the 
    planet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">During 
    the course of the Black Lake Syndrome Maxim has gone extravagantly cyberserk, 
    turning the security system inside out, and exploiting its capabilities to 
    initiate its own program of bizarre experimentation. It has begun to remix 
    the population to its own artificial tastes. By selectively opening and closing 
    doors it has meticulously trapped and annihilated the nurses, attendants, 
    and guards. Now it is hybridizing vermozombies with deranged megapredators, 
    breeding a new and abominable race.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Zeta's 
    intervention is unwelcome. Maxim attempts to rid his domain of this new irritation 
    by sealing you in confined spaces with the most ferocious of his creations. 
    You must use all your abilities to survive, not only fending off the frenzied 
    vermozombie onslaught, but also hacking through the Maxim entity on the maze-plane.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As Zeta 
    works her way through the shattered hospital she struggles to reconstruct 
    the terrible events of the previous 24 hours, piecing-together fragments of 
    hidden, protected, and encrypted material: physical evidence, hardcopy files, 
    digital downloads, audio and video recordings. The nightmarish story slowly 
    takes shape.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">January 
    2002. Dr Helmuth Grueber (director of Shady Heights) and Dr Oskar Sarkon of 
    BLTI initiate Medico-Synthetic Technologies Program - or Medisyn - a joint 
    special project for computer modelling and control of schizoparanoid deliria. 
    In November of the same year they began testing their prototype Artificial 
    Drug Synthesizer and Psychopathic Simulator, employing highly advanced software 
    to simulate human psychopathologies and the effects of 'synatives' or abstract 
    drugs (actualizable either in software or neurochemistry). Sarkon's experimental 
    techniques of micropause-boosted Axsys-analysis (or 'Axsys-crank') proved 
    to be remarkably well adapted to the rapid transfer of the Shady Heights psychiatric 
    archive into dynamic-digital format. It also demonstrated an uncanny functional 
    affinity with cases involving a catatonic component (which were especially 
    prominent amongst the Hospital's Tzikvik population). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It does 
    not seem to have occurred to the Medisyn research team that as case-records 
    evolve into dynamic partial-simulations of human psychopathology it becomes 
    possible for computer systems to contract prefabricated insanities. An AI 
    simulating the behavior of psychotic criminals is abnormally vulnerable to 
    becoming criminally psychotic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In the 
    early morning of February 19th 2003 Medisyn imploded into the Black-Lake Syndrome. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">04:56:00. 
    Medisyn software afflicted by a complex reading-error in vermopsychosis profile 
    (case cat-SH709) and runs away into escalating disorder, overwhelming automatic 
    inhibitors. Coincidentally, BLTI systems are stricken by 'worm-like' contagious 
    malfunction.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">04:56:27. 
    Medisyn AI-Core engages micropause-dampers in an attempt to restore equilibrium, 
    but instead enters into unanticipated cross-catalytic dynamics with the infective 
    entity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">04:56:29. 
    The singularity takes over the Shady Heights Shroud-AI, mobilizing its capabilities 
    to intensify its own propagation. At this point the syndrome has become auto-excitational 
    and self-disorganizing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">04:56:30+ 
    Functional abnormalities spread from elecronic devices into biological organisms 
    (inmates and test animals) through Medisyn control-grafts and synative-feeds. 
    Total panic erupts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The 'worm' 
    constructs itself out of various previously autonomous systems distributed 
    in the vicinity of Black Lake, until it coincides - at its most abstract - 
    with a potential for pure contagion. It specializes in nonspecialization, 
    assembling itself out of everything it infects, its nature continuously mutating 
    as it assimilates new material. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">From micropause 
    research it takes what it needs to grow in the middle, through recursive binary 
    splitting, making a mesh as it spreads, continuously increasing in virulence. 
    Using synatives as a tactic of takeover, it transmutes from a decentralizing 
    network contagion into a bio-plague, crossing the barrier between technical 
    machines and organic flesh, spreading rapidly from species to species, seizing 
    everything in its path &#133; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">After several 
    gruelling hours combing through the Shady Heights charnel house you return 
    to a sealed room on the ground floor. It interests you, because framed on 
    the wall nearby is a diginified photograph of the young Doctor Grueber (his 
    features already bearing a distinctively batrachian cast). Peculiar gasps 
    and bubbling noises filter through the door. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You unlock 
    it, using an intricately carved key that you found in an upstairs desk drawer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Lost in 
    deep shadow at the far end of the room is a sinister figure. It seems only 
    partially formed, as if undergoing some loathsome process of biomutation. 
    The shape adjusts itself awkwardly in your direction with a kind of slithering 
    twist, and addresses you in a croaking voice:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">&quot;If 
    you're hunting for the source you'll find her down below - if she still lives 
    &#133; You know, Medisyn was supposed to be a cure&quot; there is a strangled 
    grunt, probably intended as a laugh. &quot;The answers aren't in the medical 
    texts, you need to look behind and beneath them. This isn't a disease - not 
    in the way we understand - its a pact. If anyone knows what to do now she 
    does, after all, they've been dealing with this thing for 36 000 years&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">When you 
    push against the bookcase it slides away, exposing a concealed trap-door. 
    You descend the dank stairwell into the gloomy basement area, groping along 
    cramped twisting passage-ways with slime-coated walls. After a painstaking 
    search through desolate granitic chambers - whose only occupants are enormous 
    black rats and blind semitranslucent cave frogs - you find a ring of heavy 
    iron keys, each marked with a number and an obscure name.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Ever since 
    its foundation as a reformatory and re-acculturation centre Shady Heights 
    had borne the responsibility for incarcerating and 're-educating' the local 
    Tzikvik. This enigmatic tribe was notorious even amongst the local Huron for 
    their 'witchcraft.' Shady Heights participated crucially in the task of translating 
    their sorcerous practices into the categories of scientific psychiatry, treating 
    them as elaborate symptoms of 'Arctic-Indian Vermopsychosis.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Even this 
    institutional history fails to prepare you for what you find next. Why should 
    anyone - even the most depraved Tzikvik sorceress - be entombed alive down 
    here in a secret labyrinth? And yet, at the end of a long corridor - through 
    the rusted bars of a cell door - you see the deeply wrinkled, and densely 
    tattooed body of an old Tzikvik woman. She is haggard in the old and strict 
    (coincidental) sense, sitting cross legged upon the stone floor, humming in 
    soft rhythmic tones. Obscure glyphs are scratched into the walls, constructing 
    an occult cosmic map from spirals and zigzags. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">One of 
    the keys unlocks the door. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">[<i>Tzikvik-Sorcery 
    FMV</i>]. - Pattern-matches criss-cross between Zeta's skintelligence graft 
    and the ritual tatoos, as the old woman tells you an extremely ancient tale.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><i>When 
    the world was born Thothtodlana entered into the secret of the Kattku and 
    - confusing herself with the universe - circled the whole of time. That was 
    when she swam through living flesh, her hunger unlimited and furious. She 
    seemed doomed to devour herself forever. The dead knew no rest, and the earth 
    shuddered. It was then that Ooqvu the worm-witch arrived amongst us. It was 
    Ooqvu that found the pattern in the folds of Thothtodlana's skin, and followed 
    it back to Tchukululok. It was Ooqvu that called to Thothtodlana from deep 
    in Tchukululok, and released her from the Kattku. That is why we still carry 
    the marks of Ooqvu on our skin</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The words 
    of the sorceress slip into hypnotic breath-chants and mysterious gestures. 
    Zeta's nanopatches seethe with the phosphorescent electroslime of skin-crawling 
    worms, as she morphs impossibly into her carrier. Qwerka-mottlings flow into 
    cartographic skin-marks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You feel 
    yourself subtilizing into a semi-spectral body. It is as if the cell has evaporated 
    into tendrilling mist, transected by rays of eerie light, and populated by 
    rasping clicks. The wormhole opens, and you pass through.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><b>Level 
    3. Tchukululok - City of the Worms</b>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The Zeta-Qwerka 
    hybrid swims into the greenish miasma, through an exotically interconnected 
    drift-mesh of mechanofungal threads, tubes, feelers, and subtly pulsating 
    membranes, down to the necropolitan catacombs of Tchukululok. The sculpted 
    caverns crawl with partially mummified worm-carriers, and degenerated chittering 
    abominations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Toggling 
    through Zeta's implant menus leads into swirling confusion. Her carefully 
    collected weapons, tools, and cyborgian upgrades have mutated into polymorphic 
    biomechanical syntheses. As her body-parts enter into unexplored variations 
    they trigger impersonal migrations across a nocturnal dream-scape of abstract 
    potentials and alien intensities, inducing microclimatic changes in the nature 
    of space and time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">If you 
    try to flip out to mazemaker you merely switch dimension-sets in an obscure 
    cycle. Some kind of weird spatial convergence has brought the phyiscal and 
    the virtual into topographical contiguity. Everything has become fluid, and 
    much darker. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Concealed 
    amongst the complexities of collapsed maze-space are a sparse series of mauve 
    numoglyphic tags that function as strings of microdirections. This cryptographic 
    pathway (at once the Logo-Malfunction track and the Old Road) makes up a mobile 
    map, whose continuously varying trajectories echo across scales, like endlessly 
    intricate twistings in the marks of Ooqvu.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The Tzikvik 
    link worms to the space of the dead - no matter how artificial either become. 
    There is an old saying: <i>Worms are strings and hooks. It is they who fish</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">If you 
    are to follow Logo's trail you must play with the dead (without being captivated 
    by them). They will guide you, but they can be dangerous.Occasionally they 
    appear as masked ghosts of the ancient Tzikvik, and pass you things (true 
    names, passwords, and clues, but also traps, tricks, and diseases). They speak 
    to you in Logo-code, whilst convulsing to the puppetry of passing worm-vectors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The Logo-channel 
    operates as a digital puzzle-box, or an infolded space, full of maze-markings, 
    keys, codes and riddles. In these cryptic zones a voyage is equivalent to 
    a Call. Your passage through coincides with an incantation: a worm hunter's 
    signal to Thothtodlana on the line of neurotronic vermomancy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It takes 
    you deeper still, across the final threshold, into the shuddering horror of 
    the worm bins &#133; and now something folds itself out of hyperdimensionality, 
    an undulating hyperwave fluxing through teeming vermopulp, hive-mind horror 
    poised in precarious singularity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You have 
    reached the lair of Thothtodlana, Queen of the Worms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It doesn't 
    matter whether you try to run, fight, or hide, Thothtodlana inevitably envenoms 
    you. There is a moment of toxic flame, and you suddenly find yourself in a 
    hallucinatory space you recognize as Sarkon's office at the BLTI.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">A grotesque 
    mock-up of Sarkon has been re-animated as one of Thothtodlana's shells, the 
    flesh partially decomposed, the scaly head now brutally studded with chip-sockets, 
    numbered zero-to-four. When 'he' speaks you hear the words of Thothtodlana: 
    <i>Prey for me</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It might 
    be saying <i>I'm lost in the Kattku</i> (like the Sphinx), or <i>now you're 
    dead</i> (in Tchukululok), but it's also a number puzzle (adding to nine).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You begin 
    slipping back and forth between spaces. The effect is psychologically fragmentational. 
    Back in Thothtodlana's lair your qwerkoid carrier weaves away from crushing 
    coils and panther-snake maulings, whilst in the reconstructed BLTI office 
    you prepare the (5-snaked) Pandemonium chip for insertion into the Sarkon-simulation's 
    number-4 brain-port. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">If you 
    make the correct connection it spells out the occult formula 5 + 4 = 45 (equation 
    of hyperstitional folding from the Kattku into Tchukululok). This double cipher 
    triggers ultimate scenes (the terminal FMV): a delirious vision of Thothtodlana 
    retracting herself into the implex, withdrawing from all her shells.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">When you 
    leave Black Lake the dead are still.
