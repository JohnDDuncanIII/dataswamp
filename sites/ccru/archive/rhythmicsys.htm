<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" -->Rhythmic 
    Practices <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b></b></font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The generality 
    of rhythmic practices amongst all human groupings is explicable neither as 
    a natural tendency nor as a cultural universal. Rhythm-production is not cultural 
    or natural; it is the propagation of fictional quantities across a distributed 
    anorganic body. <br>
    A demonic untime always lurking on the outside of social chronologos.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It's what 
    makes you tick&#133; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">There is 
    no natural rhythm, just as there is no culture that is more than the sum of 
    its rhythms. The route from the jungle into Oedipalism starts at the point 
    where culture is confused with social production, which is then defined against 
    autocthonic nature. <br>
    Sociality is an effect of somatic chronos, but the social doublethinks time 
    as a natural given (or homogenous milieu) and a cultural achievement (discrete 
    blocks of calendric or clock time). Rhythm counts time only by producing it. 
    No time without time-marking. <br>
    No time-marking without tic distribution.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Human memory 
    is planetary amnesia: you wake up and find yourself an organism, <br>
    micrometamummified in the image of Gaia. All social systems are haunted by 
    the possibility of recursion into Mesh, which they code as Sphinx-horror, 
    flatline zombification, or shamanic voyage. Rhythmic practices always entail 
    Mesh, <br>
    since they routinely involve the decoding of biotic and technical components 
    <br>
    by a single rhythmachine. <br>
    Mesh is not a recovered nature &#150; the cybernetically organized smooth 
    fusion of Man and Machine projected by Prog Tech. There is no smooth interface:<br>
    Mesh is indistinguishable from friction, or Strata-melting. <br>
    It multiplies by dividing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Hyperrhythmic 
    demonism is driven by the dismantling of the Gaian meta-organism. <br>
    To induce possession, disrupt biorhythms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">What postmodern 
    capitalism calls neurological illness is an alternative tic distribution. 
    Sacks establishes that catalepsy is tic density at degree zero (or 9 Barkers). 
    <br>
    Fictions swarm when time cuts out. On the comazoned flatline, <br>
    cyberpunk (Case floating through the body of Wintermute), and K-Horror (Danny 
    drifting through the Overlook's bush of ghosts) hook up with cybergoth shamanic 
    time-engineering. Witchcraft is always associated with a flight into the world 
    of the dead<br>
    - a miscoding for encounters with the unlife of the earth. <br>
    As you float out into Hades, the Wild Hunt comes riding towards you. <br>
    Waking up later, you find you've lost all sense of time. When you're out with 
    Wintermute, the Faery Queen, seconds in Chronos become aeons of Mesh.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Demonic 
    untime treats regularity as something to be deterritorialized. <br>
    Catajunglist tic cultures posititize metricity by deploying it as a repulsor, 
    <br>
    evading the Death Star attractor of 4 to the floor monorhythm by counting 
    4:4 as the intensive zero from which anachronized hyperplexion is differentiated. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">BPM is 
    only ever virtual: any BPM immediately includes its own doublings and halvings 
    as potentials. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">When De 
    Landa laments that machines as yet lack sex organs, he writes as if machinics 
    were not inherently hostile to reproduction. The &quot;intimate relation&quot; 
    of demonism to machinism resides largely in the cyberotic agitation against 
    meiosis. Nuptials against nature. Demonic propagation does not require filiation. 
    <br>
    On the contrary, it is anti-filiation. <br>
    The question, then, is how do demons breed?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It's the 
    same question as: what do demons want? <br>
    But the answer is insidious: demons are what they desire &#150; conatal pressure. 
    Motive force without final purpose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Demons 
    make themselves real through rhythmic signatures. <br>
    They are mere hype, sorcerously propagated through Sonic Fiction. <br>
    Sonic fiction is not fantasy; it is a hypersystemic distribution, a pure Outside 
    in which no element can function extrinsically. Even anti-hype becomes hype. 
    Objects acquire sorcerous potential by dint of their capacity to hype delirium, 
    <br>
    while words function as a hyperglossing &#150; or hype-glossing &#150; of 
    delirial experience. Toys do not symbolise capitalist schizophrenia any more 
    than fetishes represent collective delirium. <br>
    They are part of it: intensity conductors instantiating the abstract hype 
    machine. <br>
    What you're buying into when you consume is essentially spreading. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Hubbard 
    passes off hyperfiction as fakery, defining scientology as an anti-demonic 
    practice at the same time as he denies the reality of demons. If demons are 
    essentially parasitic, as Hubbard says, it is not because they lack reality, 
    but because they are without integrity. Demonic interludes are what is subtracted 
    from identity: intensive difference in itself. Parasitism is not exploitation, 
    but hyperproduction, the abstract engineering of unforeseen gaps by molecular 
    entrepreneurs. <br>
    There is no use value to be exploited, only surplus value of code to be extracted. 
    <br>
    No one can ever see it coming, since micromultiplicties swarm out of holes 
    they themselves produce. <br>
    They arrive as an untimely loop, an escape from the everything that's probably 
    going to happen. The Golem finding a way out of the box.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Looping 
    is not cyclicity. <br>
    A cycle curves back to the origin, whereas loops dissolve beginning and end 
    into an endless middle: a sequence taken out of time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Plateau 
    engineering is positivized tension. <br>
    Desire and automatism equate easily in the dancing body, which weaves an ever 
    finer meshwork of potentials by learning to feel every microvariation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">What makes 
    it tick is not clock time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It's demonic 
    agitation making time for itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Getting 
    its hooks into you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Click click
