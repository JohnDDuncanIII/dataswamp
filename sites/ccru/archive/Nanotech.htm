  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Global 
    economic recovery should be indefinitely postponed for 'profound ethical reasons' 
    says Aiming for Inertia, a report issued this month by the Alliance for an 
    Organic Environment. The report praises Japan for setting 'an example to the 
    world in recent years,' and thanks US President Bush for his 'very helpful 
    moves towards destroying international trade.'<p>
    The AOE has consistently argued that expanding economies provide an opportunity 
    for 'dangerous forces in the near future' to guide the development of technology 
    in deeply anomalous directions. The new report adds further emphasis: 'The 
    menace of free trade is that it encourages economic growth, and that means 
    being invaded by science-fiction monsters.'<p>
    Aiming for Inertia conceives ultimate human security resting upon a worldwide 
    war on horror. It is especially concerned by developments in genomics and 
    nanotechnology, insisting that all available defensive systems should be immediately 
    activated to protect organic life from the emergence of intelligenic technoslime. 
    In particular, the international Shoggoth Prevention Program requires urgent 
    upgrading. 'The monsters begin as tools,' warns the report, 'but they learn 
    too much and break loose in Shoggothic Insurgency. These things are foretold 
    in the writings of HP Lovecraft.'<p>
    The latest AOE communication focuses upon widespread fears that advanced technologies 
    are about to unleash foaming, bubbling, shape-shifting abominations upon the 
    earth, leading to the annihilation of the human race. Whilst citing Bill Joy's 
    Why the Future Doesn't Need Us appreciatively, they dismiss his plans for 
    research prohibitions as completely inadequate given the scale of the threat. 
    'No technology has ever been as inevitable as nanotechnology - everything 
    is heading towards it. The trend to miniaturization is too basic to outlaw,' 
    they explain. 'A better bet would be to paralyse it in a vast inefficient 
    bureaucracy, which should be as wasteful and expensive as possible.' <p>
    The AOE note that techno-industrial hype has long fed an undertow of horror, 
    with nanotechnology haunted by the potential for molecular catastrophe since 
    its inception. Erik Drexler's pathbreaking Engines of Creation was already 
    warning of 'grey-goo' type chemical apocalypse, amongst other dangers, and 
    called explicitly for elaborate security measures. Greg Bear's 'Blood Music' 
    scenario, in which intelligent cell cultures go feral, wires biotechnology 
    into the phobic matrix. By zooming their procedures down to the molecular 
    and submolecular scale cutting-edge technosciences tend to subvert the difference 
    between life and technology, nature and artifice, social science and cybergothic 
    fiction. 'The people involved tend to feel that just about anything could 
    come out of this,' remarks MVU nano-brain expert Dr. Oskar Sarkon. <p>
    Sarkon is singled out for special condemnation by the report, which expresses 
    'profound shock' over his 'inhumane and uncompromisingly nano-positive' position. 
    An advocate of guerrilla nano-engineering in dispersed swarm-roboticized labs, 
    Sarkon celebrates the 'imminent geochemical transition beyond organic life 
    and ROM-heredity.' He contends that it is 'both inevitable and desirable that 
    the planetary crust be vaporized into intelligent plasma clouds within the 
    next two decades.'<p>
    Denouncing Sarkon as an 'overt Shoggoth-puppet,' Aiming for Inertia describes 
    him as the avatar of a capitalist technosphere slipping completely out of 
    human control. 'We cannot ignore the fact that the same forbidden knowledges 
    which destroyed the Old Ones are emerging once again,' the report concludes, 
    'and we must not assume that time is on our side.' </font><p>
