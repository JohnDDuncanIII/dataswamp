<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd">Markets 
    on the Periphery</font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">If you 
    leave Taipei's Chientan subway station and follow the crowd you will find 
    yourself drawn into the sprawling luminous chaos and hubbub of Shihlin Night 
    Market. Passing through a cacophony of overlapping sonic bubbles - fuzzy music 
    from numerous cheap stereos, microphone amplified vendor pitches, animated 
    bargaining processes, and the anomalous sonorous tolling of a buddhist mendicant's 
    bell - you enter into ever narrower spaces of increasing turbular density 
    which swirl with strange smells, events, and interchanges.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Streets 
    give way to alley ways tightly packed with heterogenous merchandise: spices, 
    flowers, clothes, mobile phones, pets and above all street food. Donuts, sweet 
    pies, dumplings, noodles, grilled squid, fresh fruit, fried vegetables, trays 
    of assorted sausages and roasted animal parts (occasionally recognizable by 
    their necks and feet) compete for attention with local delicacies such as 
    the infamous 'stinky tofu,' glazed tomato kebabs, and mysterious tiny seashells 
    raked back and forth over a grill. Cooking takes place on the spot while you 
    watch, immediately demonstrating the nonsegmentation of production, commerce, 
    and consumption.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The market 
    is constructed out of the juxtaposition of different spaces: covered and uncovered 
    areas, roads, shops of various sizes, shadowy stalls shrouded by incense-smoke, 
    dark paths lined with crates of fatalistically somnolent chickens - even an 
    old taoist temple - find themselves quasi-amoebically absorbed. The market 
    subverts every tendency to spatial closure, interiority, or organization. 
    Adjacent shops and restaurants adapt by losing their rigid contours, spreading 
    their goods, tables, and activities out onto the street.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In the 
    market you never know what you might find. The dense and mazelike market topography 
    encourages something akin to a 'random-access' distribution of populations 
    and tradable items, maximizing the number of encounters, or opportunities 
    for transaction. Crowds meander with a quasi-brownian motion as they eat, 
    shop, talk, meet, pass through and wander around, continuously redirected 
    by the intermingling traffic/traffick for its own sake that constitutes the 
    real life of the city.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Balancing 
    the desegmentary sprawl of the market is its tendency toward clustering. This 
    emergent arrangement - one lane devoted primarily to spices, another to fish, 
    another to blankets, etc. - fosters intense comparison and automatic competition. 
    This tendency can even become powerful enough to carry an entire market-place 
    down a line of specialized individuation (Hong Kong, for instance, has particular 
    zones dedicated to a bird market, flower market, fish market, and computer 
    market). To the citizens of demarketized capitalist societies - where the 
    basic trend is for traders to flee competition - there is something almost 
    incomprehensibly paradoxical about the intrinsic antimonopolism of spontaneous 
    markets. Why does a peasant vendor set-up their pile of vegetables right next 
    to a cluster of similar vendors selling (almost?) indistinguishable produce? 
    Such practices seem scarcely to distinguish between cooperation and competition, 
    suggesting that market immersion breeds a microcommercial culture which itself 
    constitutes a crucial 'surplus value' (comprising local knowledges of pitches 
    and techniques, population shifts, available products, stock-clearing rates, 
    and price-pressures).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The dynamic 
    tension between heterogeneous distribution and clustering continuously re-energizes 
    the market as a festival of communication, spiralling tightly into itself, 
    but also folding out to connect with everything it touches. Despite lacking 
    specialized organs of publicity and promotion micromarket vendors are pioneers 
    in transcultural semiotics, hybridizing tones, hand gestures, and indicative 
    signs with decimal notation. The arrival of commodity electronics has enabled 
    them to innovate the usage of cheap calculators as communication devices (extracting 
    an unanticipated sociomachinic dividend from what was designed as a private 
    arithmetical instrument). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Markets 
    like Shihlin can be found throughout the periphery, and yet - considering 
    how things have turned out in the West - it is impossible not to wonder: is 
    this place destined to die?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The most 
    critical conclusion of Fernand Braudel's stupendous three volume study of 
    the history of capitalism is that there is a fundamental distinction between 
    markets and the capitalist order (or &quot;system of the anti-market&quot; 
    married to the state). Capitalism proper belongs to the politically privileged 
    upper and core zone of an overall system, establishing a monopolistic / oligopolistic 
    superstratum upon the diffused and selectively exploited substratum of market 
    activity. The popularity, spontaneous innovation, and relative disorder of 
    markets makes them inconsistent with the geostrategic economic initiatives 
    and industrial planning favored by the state (functions that are entrusted 
    to politically well-connected large-scale businesses). Under the conditions 
    of organized capitalism 'the market' is associated primarily with the meta-commerce 
    of stock-trading, whilst 'marketing' is reduced to a specialized sub-function 
    of large-scale business activity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Braudel's 
    thesis helps to explain why bourgeois sentiment is so reliably and instinctively 
    anti-market, despite widespread pronouncements to the contrary. The more 'developed' 
    a society becomes the less comfortable it is with market environments. When 
    compared to uncluttered boulevards and shops - especially exclusive ones - 
    markets are not very 'nice.' Bourgeois ('civil' or 'polite') society is unanimous 
    in condemning the dirt, noise, and disorder of concrete markets, even when 
    it espouses a measure of confidence in abstract market principles. The state 
    is encouraged to adopt wide-ranging responsibility for protecting 'the public' 
    from markets, using the tools of regulation, policing, and urban planning, 
    which are enforced in the name of safety and hygiene.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It takes 
    very little to set up a 'stall' at a market place - a blanket and some merchandise 
    suffices - which enables markets to spontaneously appear on sidewalks, streetcorners, 
    and fly-overs, in parks, and underpasses, making them very difficult to eradicate 
    (and further consolidating their associations with vermin, nuisance, and disorder). 
    If metropolitan societies seem to be more readily sympathetic to pan-handlers 
    than street-traders it is because the former carry less threat of 'market 
    contamination,' and seems more amenable to public 'remedy.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The distinction 
    between the public and the private is a segmentation internal to capitalism. 
    It is produced as a function of the long-term strategic reduction of commerce 
    to 'the private sector,' complementing a 'public sector' designed to manage 
    the population: privatization of markets combined with the promotion of a 
    public sphere that communicates the agency of the state. The ideal of rigid 
    public/private differentiation plays a particularly significant role in antimarket 
    polemics because it conforms to the basic polarity of bourgeois aspiration: 
    private wealth and public order. This desire for clean and orderly public 
    spaces free of commercial activity is complemented by the endogeneous anticommercialism 
    of large-scale capital, which subordinates the culture and space of commercial 
    activity to concentrational private interest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In 'highly 
    developed' economies the anarchy of concrete market-places has been replaced 
    by the securitized space of the shopping mall (interiorized, guarded, and 
    surveilled). Instead of dark and crowded alleys, lined by open stalls - which 
    encourage a multiplicity of tactile interactions - the mall substitutes shop 
    windows and brightly lit retail displays. Every tendency to direct and anonymous 
    contact ('touching the merchandise') is relayed through the services of eager 
    attendants, pandering to the sad narcisstic pleasures of undivided attention, 
    whilst implicitly abolishing the market requirement for consumer and vendor 
    expertise. As if in compensation for the disappearance of commercial transparency, 
    the spontaneous aromatic labyrinth has become a meticulously planned maze 
    of glass and mirrorized surfaces, exhibiting a spectacular alliance with the 
    'mass-marketing' potential of televisual media (whose parodic underside is 
    the proliferation of CCTV cameras). The hazards of street food have been triumphantly 
    eradicated by 'food courts' offering a choice between alternative chains, 
    and by 'supermarkets' (which are not markets at all).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The mall 
    substitutes architectural-teleological structure for the semi-aimless trajectories 
    of the market, organizing space in conformity with a programmable segmented 
    order of discrete activities. Anyone might pass through a market, but the 
    only reason to be in a mall is to shop (or serve customers), merely 'hanging 
    out' is reconstrued as the illegitimate vagrant activity of 'loitering.' When 
    teenagers attempt to re-colonize malls, by treating them as real market-places 
    - or zones of microsocial coalescence - they trigger a security response. 
    Malls have become laboratories in which to experiment with strategies for 
    subtly dissolving 'problem populations.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As they 
    are squeezed by the twin-claws of urban planning and mallification markets 
    undergo a peculiar schizoid dissociation in the cultural unconscious of the 
    West. Their increasingly alien character entangles them in an unstable mixture 
    of phobic anxiety and lyrical attachment, which associates them ever more 
    intimately with the status and practices of peripheral populations. On the 
    one hand - abstracted and unified in the imagination - they condense into 
    a monstrous transcendent power: THE MARKET, the Thing from Outside, whose 
    inexplicable and unpredictable 'forces' surreptitiously dominate the earth. 
    On the other, they are hazily integrated into a wistful orientalism, as exotic 
    tourist attractions (foreign bazaars and souks), or as anomalous pockets of 
    immigrant eccentricity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">There is 
    nothing arbitrary about this construction which constitutes a simultaneous 
    - if fractured - response both to the autonomous or 'demonic' agency of emergent 
    commercial singularities, and to their intense alliance with the periphery 
    (with edges, outer limits, eccentricity, and marginality). Traders have always 
    operated at the edges, and insofar as true markets still exist in the West 
    they are primarily produced and supported by peripheral populations, amongst 
    whom recent immigrants have a particularly crucial role.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Markets 
    emerge wherever the periphery cuts through a culture, as a spontaneous consequence 
    of disrupted centralism, unconstrained communication, and positive disorganization.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">There is 
    undoubtedly a sense in which the repulsive forces of the metropolitan control-core 
    push whatever disturbs them to the edges, but there is also a sense in which 
    edges are everywhere.</font></p>
