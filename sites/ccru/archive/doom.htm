    scientists to encrypt barcode hex on laboratory monkeys sent into space to

    was living a double-life then. Hasn't he always? East/West - didn't matter 
    to him - con/Fusion was the ultimate goal. K-os. Which brings me to the computer 
    operating system Digigenetech sold to British Civil Service - K OS modelled 
    on vastly inferior D OS - said to be cause of the Scatter Virus in late 90s 
    as the K OS spiralled time backwards. Digigenetech won the contract from Brite 
    Consulting through a Sir Christopher Stephens - and why do you think he was 
    knighted? - said to be worth in the region of billions. It wasn't the first 
    time Stephens had abused his station. This cocksuckers got a history as long 
    as your arm but can't be touched. He's a rum fellow alright. Spent much of 
    his youth in India; father a Diplomat for British Embassy but left in very 
    strange circumstances which were never revealed. Educated at Eton for three 
    years then disappeared himself. Sightings as far off as Tibet, Malaysia, Krakow, 
    Siberia, Munich. Next thing he turns up as British attache in Washington - 
    that was the late 60s - student unrest; race riots; demos - Stephens played 
    his part. In fact, he should them how to do it. </font></p>

    was key moment, that we're certain. Stephens had been introduced to highest 
    levels of US cyber intelligence via a member of British monarchy upset with 
    growth of union power in own country; this member of the monarchy - we don't 
    know the name of - was chairman of a covert industrial-occult company called 
    N.E.S.T.E.N.E whose shares inexplicably crashed in 1974. These were major 
    players in unheimlich capital. The board went underground calling in favours 
    from other shit sucking scum - these guys were like Nazi criminals and couldn't 
    be touched; most of them - Stephens included - scuttled under the Fuzz carpet: 
    hence the Connection. </font></p>

    you don't want me to destroy you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It makes 
    sense. It makes no sense. Stop. Stephens' brother, Miles, had been a runner 
    for the Fuzz in the early 70s. He'd left a real trail of misery culminating 
    in the Bopal Twitching Nerve atrocity. Children born tentacled. Real ugly. 
    When N.E.S.T.E.N.E went down, Miles pulled a few strings and, bingo, brother 
    Christopher resurfaces. Just like the Id. Stop. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The human 
    form is being digitally tapered - models in high fashion spreads being literally 
    airbrushed into shape; cheap mass produced photo-software psycho-actively 
    depleting our shape and artificially steering procreative aesthetics; despite 
    the fact that many people in the Western hemispheres are reaching new levels 
    of obesity at an alarming rate. Why? I'll fuckin' tell you why - it's an unconscious 
    evolutionary precaution for the second Ice Age. It's time to get messy, people. 
    The 'older ones' may be losing control of human evolution despite kickstarting 
    the whole damn thing. Stop. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Back to 
    Stephens, then. DOOMSPAN was a smoke screen. The trivial game of human politics 
    played by East/West super-powers was the perfect foil for his DJYNXX cohorts, 
    spreading Pknotic Manuscript fear. DOOMSPAN would reverse engineer human DNA 
    structure causing internal particle reformation at sub-atomic level. The hex 
    would be transmitted into every home and workstation via the USSR satellites 
    the project was was meant to disrupt. The beauty was that DOOMSPAN could not 
    affect already existing human species - only the unborn through human male 
    spermatozoa and the recently conceived. DJYNXX knew the future was the children. 
    But what sort of future? And what sort of...? </font></p>

    to occult practice ring (named OBERON) in the Cleveland region said to be 
    involved in the killing and torturing of animals. Stop. One of ring, upon 
    hearing of Carter's fate, gassed himself in mother's automobile. Stop. We 
    think the ring must've turned on him, moving into human sacrifice. </font></p>
