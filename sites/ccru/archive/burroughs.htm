  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    account that follows charts William Burroughs&#8217; involvement in an occult 
    time war, and considerably exceeds most accepted conceptions of social and 
    historical probability. It is based on &#8216;sensitive information&#8217; 
    passed to the Ccru by an intelligence source whom we have called William Kaye 
    <sup>1</sup>. The narrative has been partially fictionalized in order to protect 
    this individual&#8217;s identity. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye 
    himself admitted that his experiences had made him prone to &#8216;paranoid-chronomaniac 
    hallucination,&#8217; and Ccru continues to find much of his tale extremely 
    implausible<sup>2</sup>. Nevertheless, whilst suspecting that his message 
    had been severely compromised by dubious inferences, noise, and disinformation, 
    we have become increasingly convinced that he was indeed an &#8216;insider&#8217; 
    of some kind, even if the organization he had penetrated was itself an elaborate 
    hoax, or collective delusion. Kaye referred to this organization as &#8216;The 
    Order,&#8217; or &#8211; following Burroughs &#8211; &#8216;The Board.&#8217; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
    reduced to its basic provocation, Kaye&#8217;s claim was this: <em>The Ghost 
    Lemurs of Madagascar</em><sup>3</sup> - which he also referred to as the Burroughs 
    Necronomicon &#8211; a text dating from 1987, had been an exact and decisive 
    influence on the magical and military career of one Captain Mission, three 
    centuries previously. Mission appears in historical record as a notorious 
    pirate, active in the period around 1700 AD; he was to become renowned as 
    the founder of the anarchistic colony of Libertatia, established on the island 
    of Madagascar. Kaye asserted that he had personally encountered clear evidence 
    of Burroughs&#8217; &#8216;impact upon Mission&#8217; at the private library 
    of Peter Vysparov, where Kaye worked most of his life. The Vysparov collection, 
    he unswervingly maintained, held an ancient illustrated transcript of <em>The 
    Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em>, inscribed meticulously in Mission&#8217;s 
    own hand<sup>4</sup>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye 
    assured us that the Board considered the &#8216;demonstrable time rift&#8217; 
    he was describing to be a &#8216;matter of the gravest concern&#8217;. He 
    explained that the organization had been born in reaction to a nightmare of 
    time coming apart and &#8211; to use his exact words - spiraling out of control. 
    To the Board, spirals were particularly repugnant symbols of imperfection 
    and volatility. Unlike closed loops, spirals always have loose ends. This 
    allows them to spread, making them contagious and unpredictable. The Board 
    was counting on Kaye to contain the situation. He was assigned the task of 
    terminating the spiral templex<sup>5</sup>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Hyperstition</strong></font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vysparov 
    had sought out Burroughs because of his evident interest in the convergence 
    of sorcery, dreams and fiction. In the immediate postwar years, Vysparov had 
    convened the so-called Cthulhu Club to investigate connections between the 
    fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, mythology, science and magic<sup>6</sup>, and 
    was at stage in the process of formalizing the constitution of Miskatonic 
    Virtual University (MVU), a loose aggregation of non-standard theorists whose 
    work could broadly be said to have &#8216;Lovecraftian&#8217; connotations. 
    The interest in Lovecraft&#8217;s fiction was motivated by its exemplification 
    of the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly 
    debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club. Loosely defined, the coinage 
    refers to 'fictions that make themselves real.' </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye 
    drew Ccru&#8217;s attention to Burroughs&#8217;s description of viruses in 
    <em>Ah Pook is Here</em>: 'And what is a virus? Perhaps simply a pictorial 
    series like Egyptian glyphs that makes itself real.&#8217; (AP 102). The papers 
    Kaye left for Ccru included a copy of this page of the Ah Pook text, with 
    these two sentences &#8211; italicized in the original text - heavily underlined. 
    For Kaye, the echo of Vysparov&#8217;s language was &#8216;unequivocal evidence&#8217; 
    of the Russian&#8217;s influence upon Burroughs&#8217;s work after 1958. Whether 
    or not this is the case, such passages indicate that Burroughs, like Vysparov, 
    was interested in the &#8216;hyperstitional&#8217; relations between writing, 
    signs and reality.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
    the hyperstitional model Kaye outlined, fiction is not opposed to the real. 
    Rather, reality is understood to be composed of fictions &#8211; consistent 
    semiotic terrains that condition perceptual, affective and behaviorial responses. 
    Kaye considered Burroughs&#8217; work to be &#8216;exemplary of hyperstitional 
    practice&#8217;. Burroughs construed writing &#8211; and art in general &#8211; 
    not aesthetically, but functionally, - that is to say, magically, with magic 
    defined as the use of signs to produce changes in reality. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye 
    maintained that it was &#8216;far from accidental&#8217; that Burroughs&#8217;s 
    equation of reality and fiction had been most widely embraced only in its 
    negative aspect &#8211; as a variety of &#8216;postmodern&#8217; ontological 
    skepticism &#8211; rather than in its positive sense, as an investigation 
    into the magical powers of incantation and manifestation: the efficacy of 
    the virtual. For Kaye, the assimilation of Burroughs into textualist postmodernism 
    constituted a deliberate act of &#8216;interpretevist sabotage&#8217;, the 
    aim of which was to de-functionalise Burroughs&#8217;s writings by converting 
    them into aesthetic exercises in style. Far from constituting a subversion 
    of representative realism, the postmodern celebration of the text without 
    a referent merely consummates a process that representative realism had initiated. 
    Representative realism severs writing from any active function, surrendering 
    it to the role of reflecting, not intervening in, the world. It is a short 
    step to a dimension of pristine textuality, in which the existence of a world 
    independent of discourse is denied altogether. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to Kaye, the metaphysics of Burroughs&#8217;s &#8216;clearly hyperstitional&#8217; 
    fictions can be starkly contrasted with those at work in postmodernism. For 
    postmodernists, the distinction between real and unreal is not substantive 
    or is held not to matter, whereas for practitioners of hyperstition, differentiating 
    between &#8216;degrees of realization&#8217; is crucial. The hyperstitional 
    process of entities 'making themselves real' is precisely a passage, a transformation, 
    in which potentials &#8211; already-active virtualities &#8211; realize themselves. 
    Writing operates not as a passive representation but as an active agent of 
    transformation and a gateway through which entities can emerge. &#8216;[B]y 
    writing a universe, the writer makes such a universe possible.&#8217; (WV 
    321) </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    these operations do not occur in neutral territory, Kaye was quick to point 
    out. Burroughs treats all conditions of existence as results of cosmic conflicts 
    between competing intelligence agencies. In making themselves real, entities 
    (must) also manufacture realities for themselves: realities whose potency 
    often depends upon the stupefaction, subjugation and enslavement of populations, 
    and whose existence is in conflict with other &#8216;reality programs&#8217;. 
    Burroughs&#8217;s fiction deliberately renounces the status of plausible representation 
    in order to operate directly upon this plane of magical war. Where realism 
    merely reproduces the currently dominant reality program from inside, never 
    identifying the existence of the program as such, Burroughs seeks to get outside 
    the control codes in order to dismantle and rearrange them. Every act of writing 
    is a sorcerous operation, a partisan action in a war where multitudes of factual 
    events are guided by the powers of illusion &#8230; (WV 253-4). Even representative 
    realism participates &#8211; albeit unknowingly &#8211; in magical war, collaborating 
    with the dominant control system by implicitly endorsing its claim to be the 
    only possible reality.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
    the controllers&#8217; point of view, Kaye said, &#8216;it is of course imperative 
    that Burroughs is thought of as merely a writer of fiction. That&#8217;s why 
    they have gone to such lengths to sideline him into a ghetto of literary experimentation.&#8217;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
    One God Universe</strong></font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Burroughs 
    names the dominant control program One God Universe, or OGU. He wages war 
    against the fiction of OGU, which builds its monopolistic dominion upon the 
    magical power of the Word: upon programming and illusion. OGU establishes 
    a fiction, which operates at the most fatal level of reality, where questions 
    of biological destiny and immortality are decided. &#8216;Religions are weapons&#8217; 
    (WL 202). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
    order to operate effectively, OGU must first of all deny the existence of 
    magical war itself. There is only one reality: its own. In writing about magical 
    war, Burroughs is thus already initiating an act of war against OGU, mainlining 
    contestation into &#8216;primal unity.&#8217; OGU incorporates all competing 
    fictions into its own story (the ultimate metanarrative), reducing alternative 
    reality systems to negatively-marked components of its own mythos: other reality 
    programs become Evil, associated with the powers of deception and delusion. 
    OGU&#8217;s power works through fictions that repudiate their own fictional 
    status: antifictions and unnonfictions. &#8216;And that,&#8217; Kaye said, 
    &#8216;is why fiction can be a weapon in the struggle against Control.&#8217;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    In OGU, fiction is safely contained by a metaphysical &#8216;frame,&#8217; 
    prophylactically delimiting all contact between the fiction and what is outside 
    it. The magical function of words and signs is both condemned as evil and 
    declared to be delusory, facilitating a monopoly upon the magical power of 
    language for OGU (which of course denies that its own mythos exerts any magical 
    influence, presenting it as a simple representation of Truth). But OGU&#8217;s 
    confidence that fiction has safely been contained means that anti-OGU agents 
    can use fiction as a covert line of communication and a secret weapon: &#8216;he 
    concealed and revealed the knowledge in fictional form&#8217; (WV 455).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, 
    for Kaye, was &#8216;a formula for hyperstitional practice.&#8217; Diagrams, 
    maps, sets of abstract relations, tactical gambits, are as real in a fiction 
    about a fiction about a fiction as they are encountered raw, but subjecting 
    such semiotic contraband to multiple embeddings allows a traffic in materials 
    for decoding dominant reality that would otherwise be proscribed. Rather than 
    acting as transcendental screens, blocking out contact between itself and 
    the world, the fiction acts as a Chinese box &#8211; a container for sorcerous 
    interventions in the world. The frame is both used (for concealment) and broken 
    (the fictions potentiate changes in reality). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas 
    hyperstitional agitation produces a &#8216;positive unbelief&#8217; &#8211; 
    a provisionalizing of any reality frame in the name of pragmatic engagement 
    rather than epistemological hesitation - OGU feeds on belief. In order to 
    work, the story that runs reality has to be believed, which is also to say 
    that the existence of a control program determining reality must not be suspected 
    or believed. Credulity in the face of the OGU meta-narrative is inevitably 
    coupled with a refusal to accept that entities like Control have any substantive 
    existence. That&#8217;s why, to get out of OGU, a systematic shedding of all 
    beliefs is a prerequisite. &#8216;Only those who can leave behind everything 
    they have ever believed in can hope to escape.&#8217; (WL 116) Techniques 
    of escape depend on attaining the unbelief of assassin-magician Hassan i Sabbah: 
    nothing is true, everything is permitted. Once again, Kaye cautioned that 
    this must be carefully distinguished from &#8216;postmodern relativism.&#8217; 
    Burroughs-Sabbah&#8217;s &#8216;nothing is true&#8217; cannot be equated with 
    postmodernism&#8217;s &#8216;nothing is real.&#8217; On the contrary: nothing 
    is true because there is no single, authorized version of reality &#8211; 
    instead, there is a superfluity, an excess, of realities. &#8216;The Adversary&#8217;s 
    game plan is to persuade you that he does not exist.&#8217; (WL 12)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    <strong>The Episode</strong></font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye&#8217;s 
    story began in the summer of 1958, when his employer Peter Vysparov met William 
    Burroughs whilst conducting occult investigations in Paris<sup>7</sup>. As 
    a result of this meeting Kaye was himself introduced to Burroughs on December 
    23rd of the same year, at Vysparov&#8217;s private library in New York. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    is clear from public documentary material that Burroughs was predominantly 
    resident in Paris and London at this time. Ccru found no evidence of any trip 
    to the USA, although his biography is not sufficiently comprehensive to rule 
    out an excursion to NY with confidence. There is no doubt, however, that shortly 
    after the winter of 1958 Burroughs starts writing cryptically of visions, 
    &#8216;paranormal phenomena,&#8217; encountering his double, and working with 
    cut up techniques<sup>8</sup>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
    Burroughs hunted through the library&#8217;s unparalleled collection of rare 
    occult works, he made a discovery that involved him in a radical, apparently 
    unintelligible disorder of time and identity. The trigger was his encounter 
    with a text that he was yet to compose: &#8216;an old picture book with gilt 
    edged lithographs, onion paper over each picture, <em>The Ghost Lemurs of 
    Madagascar</em> in gold script&#8217; (GLM 30). He could not then have known 
    that Captain Mission had taken the very same volume as his guide three centuries 
    previously (already describing it as &#8216;old&#8217;). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flipping 
    through the pages, Burroughs entered a momentary catatonic trance state. He 
    emerged disoriented, and scarcely able to stand. Despite his confusion, he 
    was more than willing to describe, with a strange sardonic detachment, the 
    anomalous episode<sup>9</sup>. Twenty-nine years would pass before Kaye understood 
    what had occurred. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Burroughs 
    told Kaye that, during the trance, it felt as though silent communication 
    with a ghostly non-human companion had flashed him forward to his life as 
    an old man, several decades in the future. Oppressed by &#8216;a crushing 
    sensation of implacable destiny, as if fragments of a frozen time dimension 
    were cascading into awareness,&#8217; he &#8216;remembered&#8217; writing 
    <em>The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em> &#8211; &#8216;although it wasn&#8217;t 
    writing exactly,&#8217; and his writing implements were archaic, belonging 
    to someone else entirely, in another place and time. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even 
    after his recovery the sense of oppression persisted, like a &#8216;new dimension 
    of gravity.&#8217; The vision had granted him &#8216;horrific insight into 
    the jail-house mind of the One God.&#8217; He was convinced the knowledge 
    was &#8216;dangerous&#8217; and that &#8216;powerful forces were conspiring 
    against him,&#8217; that the &#8216;invisible brothers are invading present 
    time&#8217; (WV 220). The episode sharpened his already vivid impression that 
    the human animal is cruelly caged in time by an alien power. Recalling it 
    later he would write &#8216;Time is a human affliction; not a human invention 
    but a prison.&#8217; (GC 16-17)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    there is no direct historical evidence supporting Kaye&#8217;s description 
    of events, the immediate period after the 1958 &#8216;episode&#8217; provides 
    compelling symptomatic evidence of a transformation in Burroughs&#8217;s strategies 
    and preoccupations during this period . It was then that Burroughs&#8217;s 
    writing underwent a radical shift in direction, with the introduction of experimental 
    techniques whose sole purpose was to escape the bonds of the already-written, 
    charting a flight from destiny. Gysin&#8217;s role in the discovery of these 
    cut-ups and fold ins is well-known, but Kaye&#8217;s story accounts for the 
    special urgency with which Burroughs began deploying these new methods in 
    late 1958. The cut-ups and fold-ins were &#8216;innovative time-war tactics&#8217;, 
    the function of which was to subvert the foundations of the prerecorded universe<sup>10</sup>. 
    &#8216;Cut the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred &#8230;.The 
    Word Lines keep you in time&#8230;&#8217; (WV 270). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Burroughs&#8217;s 
    adoption of these techniques was, Kaye told Ccru, &#8216;one of the first 
    effects (if one may be permitted to speak in so loose a way) of the time-trauma.&#8217; 
    Naturally, Kaye attributes Burroughs&#8217;s intense antipathy towards prerecording 
    &#8211; a persistent theme in his fiction after Naked Lunch &#8211; to his 
    experiences in the Vysparov library. The &#8216;cosmic revelation&#8217; in 
    the library produced in Burroughs &#8216;a horror so profound&#8217; that 
    he would dedicate the rest of his life to plotting and propagating escape 
    routes from &#8216;the board rooms and torture banks of time&#8217; (NE 33). 
    Much later Burroughs would describe a crushing feeling of inevitability, of 
    life being scripted in advance by malign entities: &#8216;the custodians of 
    the future convene. Keepers of the Board Books: <em>Mektoub</em>, it is written. 
    And they don&#8217;t want it changed.&#8217; (GC 8)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was in the immediate aftermath of the episode in the Vysparov library that 
    Burroughs exhibited the first signs of an apparently random attachment to 
    lemurs, the decisive implications of which took several decades to surface. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Burroughs 
    was unsure who was running him, like &#8216;a spy in somebody else&#8217;s 
    body where nobody knows who is spying on whom&#8217; (WV xxviii). Until the 
    end of his life he struggled against the &#8216;Thing inside him. The Ugly 
    Spirit&#8217; (GC 48), remarking that: &#8216;I live with the constant threat 
    of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from Control.&#8217; 
    (WV 94) <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Escaping Control</strong></font></p>

    Burroughs&#8217; mythology, OGU emerges once MU (the Magical Universe) is 
    violently overthrown by the forces of monopoly (WL 113). The Magical Universe 
    is populated by many gods, eternally in conflict: there is no possibility 
    of unitary Truth, since the nature of reality is constantly contested by heterogeneous 
    entities whose interests are radically incommensurable. Where monotheistic 
    fiction tells of a rebellious secession from the primordial One, Burroughs 
    describes the One initiating a war against the Many: </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    &#8216;These were troubled times. There was war in the heavens as the One 
    God attempted to exterminate or neutralize the Many Gods and establish an 
    absolute seat of power. The priests were aligning themselves on one side or 
    the other. Revolution was spreading up from the South, moving from the East 
    and from the Western deserts.&#8217; (WL 101) </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OGU 
    is &#8216;antimagical, authoritarian, dogmatic, the deadly enemy of those 
    who are committed to the magical universe, spontaneous, unpredictable, alive. 
    The universe they are imposing is controlled, predictable, dead.&#8217; (WL 
    59) Such a universe gives rise to the dreary paradoxes &#8211; so familiar 
    to monotheistic theology - that necessarily attend omnipotence and omniscience. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    &#8216;Consider the One God Universe: OGU. The spirit recoils in horror from 
    such a deadly impasse. He is all-powerful and all-knowing. Because He can 
    do everything, He can do nothing, since the act of doing demands opposition. 
    He knows everything, so there is nothing for him to learn. He can&#8217;t 
    go anywhere, since He is already fucking everywhere, like cowshit in Calcutta. 
    &#8230; The OGU is a prerecorded universe in which He is the recorder.&#8217;

  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
    Kaye, the superiority of Burroughs&#8217;s analysis of power &#8211; over 
    &#8216;trivial&#8217; ideology critique - consists in its repeated emphasis 
    on the relationship between control systems and temporality. Burroughs is 
    emphatic, obsessive: &#8216;[I]n Time any being that is spontaneous and alive 
    will wither and die like an old joke.&#8217; (WL 111) &#8216;A basic impasse 
    of all control machines is this: Control needs time in which to exercise control.&#8217; 
    (WV 339) OGU control codings far exceed ideological manipulation, amounting 
    to cosmic reality programming, because &#8211; at the limit &#8211; &#8216;the 
    One God is Time&#8217; (WL 111). The presumption of chronological time is 
    written into the organism at the most basic level, scripted into its unconsciously 
    performed habituated behaviors:</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;Time 
    is that which ends. Time is limited time experienced by a sentient creature. 
    Sentient of time, that is - making adjustments to time in terms of what Korzybski 
    calls neuro-muscular intention behaviour with respect to the environment as 
    a whole ... A plant turns towards the sun, nocturnal animal stirs at sun set 
    ... shit, piss, move, eat, fuck, die. Why does Control need humans? Control 
    needs time. Control needs human time. Control needs your shit piss pain orgasm 
    death.&#8217; (AP 17)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Power 
    operates most effectively not by persuading the conscious mind, but by delimiting 
    in advance what it is possible to experience. By formatting the most basic 
    biological processes of the organism in terms of temporality, Control ensures 
    that all human experience is of &#8211; and in &#8211; time. That is why time 
    is a &#8216;prison&#8217; for humans. &#8216;Man was born in time. He lives 
    and dies in time. Wherever he goes he takes time with him and imposes time.&#8217; 
    (GC 17) Korzybski&#8217;s defintion of man as the 'time-binding animal' has 
    a double sense for Burroughs. On the one hand, human beings are binding time 
    for themselves: they &#8216;can make information available over any length 
    of time to other men through writing.' (GC 66) On the other hand, humans are 
    binding themselves into time, building more of the prison which constrains 
    their affects and perceptions. &#8216;Korzybski&#8217;s words took on a horrible 
    new meaning for Burroughs in the library,&#8217; Kaye said, &#8216;he saw 
    what time-binding really was, all the books, already written, time bound forever.&#8217;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 
    writing customarily operates as the principal means of &#8216;time-binding&#8217;, 
    Burroughs reasoned that innovating new writing techniques would unbind time, 
    blowing a hole in the OGU &#8216;pre-sent&#8217;, and opening up Space. &#8216;Cut 
    the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred &#8230;.The Word 
    Lines keep you in time&#8230;Cut the in lines&#8230;Make out lines to Space.&#8217; 
    (WV 270) Space has to be understood not as empirical extension, still less 
    as a transcendental given, but in the most abstract sense, as the zone of 
    unbound potentialities lying beyond the purview of the OGU&#8217;s already-written.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;You 
    can see that Burroughs&#8217;s writing involves the highest possible stakes,&#8217; 
    Kaye wrote. &#8216;It does not represent cosmic war: it is already a weapon 
    in that war. It is not surprising that the forces ranged against him &#8211; 
    the many forces ranged against him, you can&#8217;t overestimate their influence 
    on this planet &#8211; sought to neutralize that weapon. It was a matter of 
    the gravest urgency that his works be classified as fantasies, experimental 
    dada, anything but that they should be recognized as what they are: technologies 
    for altering reality.&#8217; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
    Rift</strong><br>
    <br>
    For almost thirty years Burroughs had sought to evade the inevitable. Yet 
    numerous signs indicate that by the late 1980&#8217;s the Control Complex 
    was breaking down, redirecting Burroughs&#8217;s flight from prerecorded destiny 
    into a gulf of unsettled fate that he came to call &#8216;the Rift.&#8217; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaye 
    consistently maintained than any attempt to date Burroughs&#8217;s encounter 
    with the Rift involved a fundamental misconception. Nevertheless, his own 
    account of this &#8216;episode&#8217; repeatedly stressed the importance of 
    the year 1987, a date that marked a period of radical transition: the &#8216;eye&#8217; 
    of a &#8216;spiral templex.&#8217; It was during this time that the obscure 
    trauma at the Vysparov library flooded back with full force, saturating </font><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Burroughs&#8217;s 
    dreams and writings with visions of lemurs, ghosts from the Land of the Dead.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1987 
  was the year in which Burroughs visited the Duke University Lemur Conservation 
  Center, consolidating an alliance with the non-anthropoid primates, or prosimians<sup>11</sup>. 
  In <em>The Western Lands</em> &#8211; which Burroughs was writing during this 
  year &#8211; he remarks that: &#8216;At sight of the Black Lemur, with round 
  red eyes and a little red tongue protruding, the writer experiences a delight 
  that is almost painful.&#8217; (WL 248). Most crucially, it was in 1987 that 
  Omni magazine commissioned and published Burroughs&#8217;s short story <em>The 
  Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em>, a text that propelled his entire existence 
  into the Rift of Lemurian Time Wars. 
  <p></p>
  For some time previously Kaye&#8217;s suspicions had been aroused by Burroughs&#8217;s 
  increasingly obsessional attitude to his cats. His devotion to Calico, Fletch, 
  Ruski, and Spooner<sup>12</sup> exhibited a profound biological response that 
  was the exact inversion of his instinctual revulsion for centipedes. His libidinal 
  &#8216;conversion to a cat man&#8217; (WV 506) also tracked and influenced an 
  ever deepening disillusionment with the function of human sexuality, orgasm 
  addiction, and Venusian conspiracy. 
  <p></p>
  &#8216;Cats may be my last living link to a dying species&#8217; (WV 506) Burroughs 
  wrote in his essay The Cat Inside. For Kaye it was evident that this intensifying 
  attachment to domestic felines was part of a more basic current, typified by 
  an intimate familiarization with the &#8216;cat spirit&#8217; or &#8216;creature&#8217; 
  who partakes of many other species, (including &#8216;raccoons, ferrets, &#8230; 
  skunks&#8217;, (CRN 244) and numerous varieties of lemurs, such as &#8216;ring-tailed 
  cat lemurs&#8217; (GC 3), the sifaka lemur &#8230; mouse lemur (GC 4), and ultimately 
  &#8216;the gentle deer lemur&#8217; (GC 18). As initiatory beings, mediumistic 
  familiars, or occult door-keepers these animals returned Burroughs to lost Lemurian 
  landscapes, and to his double, Captain Mission. 
  <p></p>
  Kaye was highly dismissive of all critical accounts that treated Mission as 
  a literary avatar, &#8216;as if Burroughs was basically an experimental novelist.&#8217; 
  He maintained that the relation between Burroughs and Mission was not that of 
  author to character, but rather that of &#8216;anachronistic contemporaries,&#8217;<sup>13</sup> 
  bound together in a knot of &#8216;definite yet cognitively distressing facts.&#8217; 
  Of these &#8216;facts&#8217; none was more repugnant to common human rationality 
  than their mutual involvement with <em>The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em>. 
  <p></p>
  &#8216;We offer refuge to all people everywhere who suffer under the tyranny 
  of governments&#8217; (CRN 265) declared Mission<sup>14</sup>. This statement 
  was sufficient to awaken the hostile interest of the Powers That Be, although, 
  from the Board&#8217;s perspective, even Mission&#8217;s piratical career was 
  a relatively trivial transgression. Their primary concern was &#8216;a more 
  significant danger&#8217; &#8230; Captain Mission&#8217;s unwholesome concern 
  with <em>lemurs</em>.&#8217; (GLM 28). 
  <p></p>
  &#8216;Mission was spending more and more time in the jungle with his lemurs&#8217; 
  (GC 11) - the ghosts of a lost continent - slipping into time disturbances and 
  spiral patterns. Lemurs became his sleeping and dream companions. He discovered 
  through this dead and dying species that the key to escaping control is taking 
  the initiative - or the pre-initiative &#8211; by interlinking with the Old 
  Ones. 
  <p></p>
  </font> <font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;The 
  Lemur people are older than Homo Sap, much older. They date back one hundred 
  sixty million years, to the time when Madagascar split off from the mainland 
  of Africa. They might be called psychic amphibians &#8211; that is, visible 
  only for short periods when they assume a solid form to breathe, but some of 
  them can remain in the invisible state for years at a time. Their way of thinking 
  and feeling is basically different from ours, not oriented toward time and sequence 
  and causality. They find these concepts repugnant and difficult to understand.&#8217; 
  (GLM 31). </font></p> 
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Board conceived Mission&#8217;s traffic with lemurs, his experiments in time 
  sorcery, and his anachronistic entanglement with Burroughs as a single intolerable 
  threat. &#8216;In a prerecorded and therefore totally predictable universe, 
  the blackest sin is to tamper with the prerecording, which could result in altering 
  the prerecorded future. Captain Mission was guilty of this sin.&#8217; (GLM 
  27) 
  <p></p>
  &#8216;Now more lemurs appear, as in a puzzle.&#8217; (GC 15) Lemurs are denizens 
  of the Western Lands, the &#8216;great red island&#8217; (GC 116) of Madagascar, 
  which Mission knew as Western Lemuria<sup>15</sup>, &#8216;The Land of The Lemur 
  People&#8217; (NE 98), a Wild West. It was on the island of Madagascar that 
  Captain Mission discovered &#8216;the word for &#8220;lemur&#8221; meant &#8220;ghost&#8221; 
  in the native language&#8217; (GC 2) - just as the ancient Romans spoke of <em>lemures</em>, 
  wraiths, or shades of the dead<sup>16</sup>. 
  <p></p>
  In their joint voyage across the ghost continent of Lemuria, interlinked by 
  lemurs, Mission and Burroughs find &#8216;immortality&#8217; through involvement 
  with the native populations of unlife. In describing this process, Kaye placed 
  particular emphasis on Burroughs 1987 visit to the Duke University Lemur Center. 
  It was this colony of lemurs that introduced Burroughs to the West Lemurian 
  &#8216;time pocket&#8217; (GC 15), just as &#8216;Captain Mission was drifting 
  out faster and faster, caught in a vast undertow of time. &#8220;Out, and under, 
  and out, and out,&#8221; a voice repeated in his head.&#8217; (GC 17). <em>If 
  time-travel ever happens, it always does</em>. 
  <p></p>
  He finds himself at the gateway, inside the &#8216;ancient stone structure&#8217; 
  (GLM 28) with the lemur who is &#8216;his phantom, his Ghost&#8217; (GLM 29), 
  seated at a writing table (&#8216;with inkpot, quill, pens, parchment&#8217; 
  (GLM 29). He uses a native drug to explore the gateway. Who built it? When? 
  The tale comes to him in a time-faulted vision, transmitted in hieroglyphics. 
  He &#8216;chooses a quill pen&#8217; (GLM 29). 
  <p></p>
  It is difficult to describe where the text comes from, but there it is: &#8216;an 
  old illustrated book with gilt edges. <em>The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em>&#8217; 
  (GLM 29); &#8216;an old picture book with gilt edged lithographs, onion paper 
  over each picture, The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar in gold script&#8217; (GLM 
  30). The vision echoes or overlaps, time-twinning waves where Mission and Burroughs 
  coincide. They copy an invocation or summoning, a joint templex innovation that 
  predates the split between creation and recording, reaching back &#8216;before 
  the appearance of man on earth, before the beginning of time.&#8217; (GC 15). 
  <p></p>
  &#8216;When attached to Africa, Madagascar was the ultimate landmass, sticking 
  out like a disorderly tumor cut by a rift of future contours, this long rift 
  like a vast indentation, like the cleft that divides the human body.&#8217; 
  (GC 16) 
  <p></p>
  They feel themselves thrown forward 160 million years as they access the Big 
  Picture, a seismic slippage from geological time into transcendental time anomaly. 
  The island of Madagascar shears away from the African mainland<sup>17</sup>, 
  whilst - on the other side of time &#8211; Western Lemuria drifts back up into 
  the present. The Lemurian continentity sinks into the distant future, stranding 
  the red island with its marooned lemur people. &#8216;What is the meaning of 
  160 million years without time? And what does time mean to foraging lemurs?&#8217; 
  (GC 16-17) 
  <p></p>
  Time crystallizes, as concentric contractions seize the spiral mass. From deep 
  in the ages of slow Panic<sup>18</sup> they see the &#8216;People of the Cleft, 
  formulated by chaos and accelerated time, flash through a hundred sixty million 
  years to the Split. Which side are you on? Too late to change now. Separated 
  by a curtain of fire.&#8217; (GLM 31). 
  <p></p>
  <em> The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em> opens out onto the Rift, &#8216;the 
  split between the wild, the timeless, the free, and the tame, the time-bound, 
  the tethered&#8217; (GC 13) as one side &#8216;of the rift drifted into enchanted 
  timeless innocence,&#8217; and the other &#8216;moved inexorably toward language, 
  time, tool use, weapon use, war, exploitation, and slavery.&#8217; (GC 49) 
  <p></p>
  Which side are you on? 
  <p></p>
  As time rigidifies The Board closes in on the Lemur people, on a chance that 
  has already passed, a ghost of chance, a chance that is already dead: &#8216;the 
  might-have-beens who had one chance in a billion and lost.&#8217; (GC 18). Exterminate 
  the brutes. &#8230; &#8216;Mission knows that a chance that occurs only once 
  in a hundred and sixty million years has been lost forever&#8217; (GC 21) and 
  Burroughs awakens screaming from dreams of &#8216;dead lemurs scattered through 
  the settlement &#8230;&#8217; (GC7)<sup>19</sup>. 
  <p></p>
  According to Kaye everyone &#8216;on the inside&#8217; knew about the bad dreams, 
  certain they were coming from a real place. In this, as so much else, Kaye&#8217;s 
  reconstruction of the 1987 event depended centrally upon <em>The Ghost Lemurs 
  of Madagascar</em>, an account he cited as if it were a strictly factual record, 
  even a sacred text. He explained that this interpretative stance had been highly 
  developed by the Board, since respecting the reality of non-actualities is essential 
  when waging war in deeply virtualized environments: in spaces that teem with 
  influential abstractions and other ghostly things. Kaye considered Bradly Martin, 
  for instance, to be entirely real. He described him as an identifiable contemporary 
  individual &#8211; working as an agent of &#8216;the Board&#8217; &#8211; whose 
  task was to seal the &#8216;ancient structure&#8217; that provides access to 
  the Rift. 
  <p></p>
  The Board had long known that the Vysparov library contained an old copy of 
  <em>The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em>, which dated itself with the words &#8216;Now, 
  in 1987&#8217; (GLM 34). It had been catalogued there since 1789. The text was 
  a self-confessed time-abomination, requiring radical correction. It disregarded 
  fundamental principles of sequence and causality, openly aligning itself with 
  the lemur people. 
  <p></p>
  What the Board needed was a dead end. Burroughs was an obvious choice, for a 
  number of reasons. He was sensitive to transmissions, amenable to misogyny and 
  mammal-chauvenism, socially marginalized, and controllable through junk. They 
  were confident, Kaye recalled, that the forthcoming 1987 &#8216;story&#8217; 
  would be &#8216;lost amongst the self-marginalizing fictions of a crumbling 
  junky fag.&#8217; 
  <p></p>
  On the outside it worked as a cover-up, but the Insiders had a still more essential 
  task. They had inherited the responsibility for enforcing the Law of Time, and 
  of OGU: Defend the integrity of the timeline. This Great Work involved horrifying 
  compromises. Kaye cited the hermetic maxim: Strict obedience to the Law excuses 
  grave transgressions. &#8216;They&#8217;re speaking of White Chronomancy&#8217; 
  he explained, &#8216;the sealing of runaway time-disturbances within closed 
  loops.&#8217;<sup>20</sup> What Mission had released Burroughs had bound again. 
  That is how it seemed to the Board in 1987, with the circle apparently complete. 
  <p></p>
  Confident that the transcendental closure of time was being achieved, the Board 
  appropriated the text as the record of a precognitive intuition, a prophecy 
  that could be mined for information. It confirmed their primary imperative and 
  basic doctrine, foretelling the ultimate triumph of OGU and the total eradication 
  of Lemurian insurgency. Mission had understood this well: &#8216;No quarter, 
  no compromise is possible. This is war to extermination.&#8217; (GC 9) 
  <p></p>
  It seems never to have occurred to the Board that Burroughs would change the 
  ending, that their &#8216;dead end&#8217; would open a road to the Western Lands<sup>21</sup>. 
  Things that should have been long finished continued to stir. It was as if a 
  post-mortem coincidence or unlife influence had vortically re-animated itself. 
  A strange doubling occurred. Burroughs entitled it <em>The Ghost of Chance</em>, 
  masking the return of the Old Ones in the seemingly innocuous words: &#8216;People 
  of the world are at last returning to their source in spirit, back to the little 
  lemur people &#8230;&#8217; (GC 54) The Board had no doubt &#8211; this was 
  a return to the true horror. 
  <p></p>
  Yet, Kaye insisted, for those with eyes to see, <em>The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar</em> 
  announced its turbular Lemurian destination from the beginning, and its final 
  words are &#8216;lost beneath the waves&#8217; (GLM 34). 
  <p></p>
  Kaye&#8217;s own final words to the Ccru, written on a scrap of paper, upon 
  which he had scrawled hurriedly in a spiderish hand that already indicated the 
  tide of encroaching insanity, remain consistent with this unsatisfactory conclusion: 
  &#8216;Across the time rift, termination confuses itself with eddies of a latent 
  spiral current.&#8217; </font></p>

    apes, and humans) and the prosimians, which include madagascan lemurs, asian 
    lorises, australian galgoes (or bushbabies), and the tarsiers of the Philippines 
    and Indonesia. The prosimians constitute a branch of evolution distinct from, 
    and older than, the anthropoids. Outside Madagascar, competition from the 
    anthropoids has driven all prosimians into a nocturnal mode of existence.

    evidenced by his final words, as recorded in his diaries: &#8216;Nothing is. 
    There is no final enough of wisdom, experience &#8211; any fucking thing. 
    No Holy Grail. No Final Satori, no final solution. Just conflict. Only thing 
    can resolve conflict is love, like I felt for Fletch and Ruski, Spooner and 
    Calico. Pure love. What I feel for my cats present and past.&#8217; (LW 253).</font></p>

  15. Puzzling consistencies between rocks, fossils, and animal species found 
  in South Asia and Eastern Africa led 19th Century palaeontologists and geologists 
  to postulate a lost landmass that once connected the two now separated regions. 
  This theory was vigorously supported by E. H. Haeckel (1834-1919), who used 
  it to explain the distribution of Lemur-related species throughout Southern 
  Africa, South and South-East Asia. On this basis, the English Zoologist Phillip 
  L Sclater (1829-1913) named the hypothetical continent Lemuria, or Land of the 
  Lemurs. Lemurs are treated as relics, or biological remainders of a hypothetical 
  continent: living ghosts of a lost world. 
  <p></p>
  Haeckel&#8217;s theoretical investment in Lemuria, however, went much further 
  than this. He proposed that the invented continent was the probable cradle of 
  the human race, speculating that it provided a solution to the Darwinian mystery 
  of the &#8216;missing link&#8217; (the absence of immediately pre-human species 
  from the fossil record). For Haeckel, Lemuria was the original home of man, 
  the &#8216;true Eden,&#8217; all traces of which had been submerged by its disappearance. 
  He considered the biological unity of the human species to have since been lost 
  (disintegrating into twelve distinct species). 
  <p></p>
  As a scientific conjecture Lemuria has been buried by scientific progress. Not 
  only have palaeontologists largely dispelled the problem of the missing link 
  through additional finds, but the science of Plate Tectonics has also replaced 
  the notion of &#8216;sunken continents&#8217; with that of continental drift. 
  <p></p>
  Now bypassed by conventional rationality as a scientific fiction or an accidental 
  myth, Lemuria sinks into obscure depths once again.</font></p>

    16. In the late 19th Century Lemuria was eagerly seized upon by occultists, 
    who &#8211; like their scientific cousins - wove it into elaborate evolutionary 
    and racial theories. <br>
    In <em>The Secret Doctrine</em>, a commentary on the Atlantean <em>Book of 
    Dzyan</em>, H.P. Blavatsky describes Lemuria as the third in a succession 
    of lost continents. It is preceded by Polarea and Hyperborea, and followed 
    by Atlantis (which was built from a fragment of Western Lemuria). Atlantis 
    immediately precedes the modern world, and two further continents are still 
    to come. According to Theosophical orthodoxy, each such &#8216;continent&#8217; 
    is the geographical aspect of a spiritual epoch, providing a home for the 
    series of seven &#8216;Root Races.&#8217; The name of each lost continent 
    is used ambiguously to designate both the core territory of the dominant root 
    race of that age, and also for the overall distribution of terrestrial landmass 
    during that period (in this latter respect it can even be seen as consistent 
    with continental drift, and thus as more highly developed than the original 
    scientific conception). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">L. 
    Sprague de Camp describes Blavatsky&#8217;s third root race, the &#8216;ape-like, 
    hermaphroditic egg-laying Lemurians, some with four arms and some with an 
    eye in the back of their heads, whose downfall was caused by their discovery 
    of sex&#8217;. There is broad consensus amongst occultists that the rear-eye 
    of the Lemurians persists vestigially as the human pineal gland. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">W. 
    Scott Elliot adds that the Lemurians had &#8216;huge feet, the heels of which 
    stuck out so far they could as easily walk backwards as forwards.&#8217; According 
    to his account the Lemurians discovered sex during the period of the fourth 
    sub-race, interbreeding with beasts and producing the great apes. This behavior 
    disgusted the transcendent spirits, or &#8216;Lhas,&#8217; who were supposed 
    to incarnate into the Lemurians, but now refused. The Venusians volunteered 
    to take the place of the Lhas, and also taught the Lemurians various secrets 
    (including those of metallurgy, weaving and agriculture). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rudolf 
    Steiner was also fascinated by the Lemurians, remarking in his <em>Atlantis 
    and Lemuria</em> that: &#8216;This Root-Race as a whole had not yet developed 
    memory.&#8217; The &#8216;Lemurian was a born magician,&#8217; whose body 
    was less solid, plastic, and &#8216;unsettled.&#8217; <br>
    More recently Lemuria has been increasingly merged into Colonel James Churchward&#8217;s 
    lost pacific continent of Mu, drifting steadily eastwards until even parts 
    of modern California have been assimilated to it. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    Blavatsky credits Sclater as the source for the name Lemuria, it cannot have 
    been lost upon her, or her fellow occultists, that Lemuria was a name for 
    the land of the dead, or the Western Lands. The word Lemur is derived from 
    Latin lemure, literally: shade of the dead. The Romans conceived the lemures 
    as vampire-ghosts, propitiated by a festival in May. In this vein, Eliphas 
    Levi writes (in his <em>History of Magic</em>) of &#8216;Larvae and lemures, 
    shadowy images of bodies which have lived and of those which have yet to come, 
    issued from these vapours by myriads&#8230;&#8217; </font></p>

    </font><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to current scientific consensus Burroughs&#8217;s figure of 160 million years 
    is exaggerated. Burroughs&#8217;s geological tale is nevertheless a recognizably 
    modern one, with no reference to continental subsidence. With the submergence 
    of the Lemuria hypothesis, however, the presence of lemurs on Madagascar becomes 
    puzzling. Lemurs are only 55 million years old, whilst Madagascar is now thought 
    to have broken away from the African mainland 120 million years ago.</font></p>

    19. Burroughs drifts out of the White Magical orbit as his lemur commitments

    20. The physical conception of 'closed time-like curves' invoke a causality 
    from the future to make the past what it is. They work to make things come 
    out as they must. If this is the only type of time-travel 'allowed' by nature 
    then it obviously shouldn't require a law to maintain it (such as the notorious 
    'don't kill granny'). The rigorous time-law policies of the Board, however, 
    indicate that the problem of &#8216;time-enforcement&#8217; is actually far 
    more intricate. </font></p>

    it gives access to the gift that supersedes all other gifts: Immortality.&#8217;
