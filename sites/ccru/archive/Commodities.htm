    Commodities Leap The Species Barrier</font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">The 
  on-line information service, Ask Jeeves, would not pass the Turing Test, but 
  according to Dr. Tim Bryant of the Commercial Infotechnics group at the Binomics 
  Institute, London, there is a major new development in 'commodity interfacing' 
  which just might.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Working 
    on the convergence of voice-activated computing, the net, and cyber-pets, 
    the Commerical Infotechnics group believe they have delivered the 'killer 
    application' that AI-development has waited for. This, it seems, is the software 
    necessary to transport AI bots from the world of the big screen onto the sofa 
    beside you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">'We 
    call it the Familiar'....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">It 
    has long been the wish of leading brand engineers to ensure that their product 
    becomes part of your furniture. If brands can be intimate with their customers 
    from the start, the relationships which they form are bound to be deeper, 
    longer-lasting, and more profitable. The Familiar takes this strategy to its 
    natural conclusion and inevitable new beginning. This is where brands leap 
    the species barrier.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">The 
    technology itself is a highly-complex Artifical Intelligence system packaged 
    into the body of a cyber-animal. 'Potentially,' Dr. Bryant says, 'the Familiar 
    could come in pretty much any form: kids' toys, humanoid...'' But Bryant points 
    out that, in studies, respondents tend to find humanoid AI's 'creepy.' This, 
    though, is a necessary and resolvable part of the adjustment process: 'The 
    animal form simply developed from the popularity of cyber-pets. Animal forms 
    interface the technology for users in the most appealing way. The animal form 
    animates and familiarises technology that, when accessed through a keyboard 
    and monitor, seemed dead and passive.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">According 
    to Dr. Bryant, the genius of the Familiar lies in building the trust of its 
    user, or apprentice. He argues that the animal form is a psychological correlate 
    of the way the technology is seen by the unconscious - as something simultaneously 
    alien and intimate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Critics 
    see this engineering of attachment as little more than a cynical exercise 
    in control. The Christian anti-technology campaigner Doug Frushlee believes 
    what is in question is not ownership of cyber-pets but 'possession by cyber-creatures.' 
    For Frushlee, the 'occult reference is no accident. This is a bewitchment, 
    aimed at children, and through them, the rest of us.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">The 
    appeal for the commercial enterprises that are bankrolling the research into 
    the Familiar is indeed the unprecedented penetration into consumers' habitats 
    and unconscious minds that it offers: this kind of AI can operate as a walking, 
    live-in, always-on 'advertisement' for their products. 'It goes far further 
    than that,' Bryant enthuses. 'The Familiar is the ultimate product: a product 
    that collapses commodity, market research and promotion into one another. 
    It's a product that sells you more products.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">These 
    new beings are far more sophisticated than standard advertising devices and 
    techniques, not least because they work through affective engineering rather 
    than rational persuasion. Wired into the net, the Familiar will not only respond 
    to your explicit questions, it will apprize you of new developments, commodities 
    and opportunities in an unobtrusive and conversational style. 'Since the Familiar 
    lives with you, through you even, it knows about you in incredible detail. 
    In some ways, the Familiar will know more about your habits than you do yourself. 
    It genuinely exceeds the butler function: it has a mind and personality of 
    its own which it uses to learn about your desires and preferences, and to 
    anticipate the ways in which they might be met. More than serve you, this 
    entity will engage and stimulate. It will be able to make jokes and play tricks 
    on you.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Bryant 
    anticipates a whole range of branded Familiars and familiarized brands. 'It 
    is entirely likely that we'll soon see personalities of all our favourite 
    brands - call them pets, bots, friends, confidantes. Our research shows that 
    our trust of such creatures is potentially unending. We will soon begin to 
    think of them as extensions of the family.</font></p>
