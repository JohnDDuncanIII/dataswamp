    Who Believes in the New Economy?<!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Cyberhype 
    consists of operative non-linear abstractions, or productive virtualities. 
    It is at once soft-product, viral-advertisement and artificially intelligent 
    media content: manic run-away into telecommercial takeover of the Earth. Built 
    out of nothing but fictions, it is still entirely real (and ever-increasingly 
    socio-economically effective). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Cyberhype 
    designates the reality of a &#145;New Economy&#146; in which economic bubble 
    and IT-boom have become indistinguishable, mutually transmuting each other 
    into something unprecedented, and thus unrecognisable. Those eagerly awaiting 
    a market &#145;correction&#146; in the direction of &#145;economic normality&#146; 
    are repeatedly disappointed (despite NASDAQ fluctuations, the US economy is 
    expected to grow by a further 5% in the year 2000). Even if it all caves in, 
    it will collapse into something unimaginably new.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Cyberpunk 
    speculations are already techno-economic infrastructure: contemporary social 
    reality condenses out of the future rather than developing from the past. 
    How could anything other than a fiction any longer be true?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><b>Who 
    Believes in the New Economy?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The recent 
    forum on the New Economy held at London&#146;s Binomics Institute entered 
    the territory of the &#145;positively unbelievable&#146;, to borrow a phrase 
    from controversial &#145;trade-guru&#146; Jack Schwarz. It was Schwarz &#151; 
    whose ideas have been criticised as &quot;less a theory than a program for 
    mass hypnosis&quot; &#151; who concluded the day&#146;s proceedings. Confused 
    and conflicting reports later described him as &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, 
    &quot;receiving instructions from invisible beings&quot;, and &quot;remaining 
    basically off-planet&quot; throughout.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">According 
    to our correspondent, events began soberly enough, with a paper from Professor 
    James Thorne of Axiomatic Systems Incorporated entitled &#145;Bubble Horror&#146;, 
    dedicated to the dangers of cyberhype-driven asset-price inflation and manipulated 
    stock-valuations. Thorne, who proudly bills himself as a &#145;neofundamentalist&#146;, 
    is well known for his frequent and scathing attacks on the &quot;witch doctors 
    of the so called new economy.&quot; &quot;What goes under the name &#145;new 
    economy&#146; isn&#146;t an economy at all,&quot; he argued. &quot;It&#146;s 
    a bubble of sheer delirium fizzing up out of mania and crazed beliefs, destined 
    to burst once traditional standards of evaluation inevitably reassert themselves.&quot; 
    Decrying the &quot;scourge of post-realism&quot;, Thorne doubts that &quot;ontologically-secure 
    profits&quot; will ever be made in a &quot;pirate-infested cyberspace, potlached 
    down to a cybercommunist wasteland ... it makes more sense to invest in the 
    moon than in web stocks.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Abstract 
    Machines&#146;s Liz Volta mocked Thorne&#146;s appeal to &#145;financial foundations&#146; 
    as a &#145;skeptico-depressive disorder&#146;, entirely dissociated from contemporary 
    reality. Her paper on &#145;The Telecommercial Condensation of Virtuality&#146; 
    described the new economy as an &quot;effectively self-consistent hype-plane 
    built out of brands, consumption potentials, and viral marketing, with audience 
    and web-traffic bought and sold as commodities. It trades in pure quanta of 
    captivation. Under these conditions apportioning value on the basis of underlying 
    actual assets is peculiarly archaic.&quot; According to Volta, belief in the 
    new economy has become a factor of production: both an operative fiction and 
    a good investment in itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Jack Schwarz&#146;s 
    paean to &#145;superconductive capitalism&#146; out-hyped even Volta&#146;s 
    enthusiastic affirmation of the virtual economy. His presentation &#145;Mindless 
    Trade&#146; promoted itself as a &quot;practical demonstration of irrational 
    exuberance&quot;, whose result would be &quot;collective ego-dissolution into 
    the hypersphere&quot;. He defined his method of &#145;positive unbelief&#146; 
    &#151; &quot;a fictional techonomic yoga from the Plateau of Leng&quot; &#151; 
    as a process of &quot;tuning into artificial reality, which is the only reality 
    left.&quot; It is no longer a matter of what is believed, but of what can 
    be treated as real. &quot;Belief and disbelief are the twin traps of maya,&quot; 
    Schwarz suggested. &quot;True fusion with the market only occurs on the plane 
    of unbelief.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Employing 
    a range of chants, sonorous gongs, gestures and other &#145;xenobuddhist&#146; 
    techniques Schwarz led the audience through some of the market channelling 
    procedures he uses when training stock- and money-brokers to &#145;clear&#146; 
    trading behaviour. &quot;... You are feeling ever more relaxed ... floating 
    in empty cyberspace ... Eliminate your own ideas.&quot; This was the last 
    distinct phrase our correspondent can remember (despite subsequent regression-hypnosis). 
    Her account of what followed remains both garbled and mystifyingly incomplete. 
    Ccru will investigate further but is meanwhile suspending belief.<br>
