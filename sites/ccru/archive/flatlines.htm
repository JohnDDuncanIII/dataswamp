    1. "In a multilinear system, everything happens at once." (ATP, 297) This 
    is Oedipus' fatal discovery. By the time he knows what has happened, he also 
    realises that what occurs always had to be the case. Oedipus' early, unwarranted, 
    belief that he is master of his fate is, of course, totally necessary for 
    his fated destiny to unfold - as it always will have done. Oedipus, as he

    I have written elsewhere at length on tragedy as a cybernetic narrative. Briefly, 
    the claim is that tragedy anticipates cybernetic explanation (or - and this 
    is obviously the same point from another side - cybernetics recalls tragic 
    fatalism). In both cases, time unravels into a flat system or singularity 
    (feeding back into itself, recursively, rather than moving forward, successively 
    (recursion is obviously a major pre-occupation of the "Flatlines" text, both 
    in its themes and in its format (with parentheses used to produce recursion 
    as a textual embedding process (like this (...))))). </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">A 
    crucial figure here is self-fulfilling prophecy; as I argue in my "Curse, 
    Recursion, Recurrence", "the most effective prophecies are always self-fulfilling" 
    (36). Walter Cannon has established that self-fulfilling prophecy is a positive-feedback 
    circuit. In his important essay, "'Voodoo' Death", Cannon shows that much 
    sorcerous cursing operates by inducing vicious circles of fear (producing 
    more fear (producing more fear) (etc))) to the point of destroying the organism. 
    To be told you're going to die is therefore, in certain circumstances, quite 
    literally a sentence of death. For a more detailed account of these tangled 
    webs, see my "Fatal Loops: Tragedy as Cyberfiction" and "Smashed Optical Implants:

    Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus . "Oedipus passes through all three secrets: 
    the secret of the sphinx whose box he penetrates; the secret that weighs upon 
    him as the infinite form of his own guilt; and finally, the secret at Colonus 
    that makes him inaccessible and melds with the pure line of his flight and 
    exile, he who has nothing left to hide, or, like an old No actor, has only 
    a girl's mask with which to cover his lack of a face." (ATP 290) The reference

    As is well known, "The horror" was to be the epigraph of T. S. Eliot's The 
    Waste Land (as it is, Eliot used "Mistah Kurtz ... he dead" as the epigraph 
    for the later "The Hollow Men"). Readers familiar with my essay "((P(re(cursing))))

    6. "[C]apitalism is the only social machine that is constructed on the basis 
    of decoded flows, substituting for intrinsic codes an axiomatic of abstract 
    quantities in the form of money." (AO, 139) As an axiomatic system, capitalism 
    replaces transcendent laws with immanent rules. (The immanence of axiomatics 
    is attested to by the fact that Deleuze and Guattari use the axiomatic method 
    in their discussion of the war machine - see "1227: Treatise On Nomadology 
    - The War Machine".) </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    As both Godel's incompleteness theorem and Cantor's diagonal numbering have 
    shown, axiomatic systems are intrinsically and necessarily incomplete: "...it 
    is of the nature of axiomatics to come up against so called undecidable propositions, 
    to confront necessarily higher powers that it cannot master." (ATP, 461) Capitalism 
    thus inevitably runs up against the problem of undecidable propositions or 
    nondenumerable sets. "At the same time as capitalism is effectuated in the 
    denumerable sets serving as its models, it necessarily constitutes nondenumerable 
    sets that cut across and disrupt those models." (ATP, 472) "Yet the very conditions 
    that make the State or World war machine possible, in other words, constant 
    capital (resources and equipment) and human variable capital, continually 
    recreate unexpected possibilities for counterattack, unforeseen initiatives 
    determining revolutionary, popular, minority, mutant machines." (ATP, 422)

    8. In his lecture on the Geology of Morals, our colleague Professor Challenger, 
    speaks of systems such as these as "stratification". "His dream was not so 
    much to give a lecture to humans as to provide a program for pure computers. 
    Or else he was dreaming of an axiomatic, for axiomatics deals essentially 
    with stratification. Challenger was addressing himself to memory only." (ATP,

    9. "Hence it is correct to retrospectively understand all history in light 
    of capitalism...In a word , universal history is not only retrospective, it 
    is also contingent, singular, ironic and critical."(AO, 140) " ..[T]he universal 
    comes at the end - the body without organs and desiring production -under 
    the conditions determined by an apparently victorious capitalism." (AO, 139).

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    10. To be inside history is to have a relation to Chronos. Yet (universal) 
    history is not itself chronological. Pure Chronos - the State's (synchronic) 
    time - can never be fully-realised, for two reasons: there is always more 
    than one State, and the State (as a form) is always in a relation with the 
    time-systems of the two other social regimes (the primitive socius - which 
    "precedes" it - and capitalism - which "succeeds" it). "Before appearing the 
    State already acts..."(ATP 431) The State appears "all at once" as history's 
    only break."They come like fate...they appear as lightening appears, too terrible, 
    too sudden." (Nietzsche, 86) Crashing into history, the State sets off time 
    waves that move in both directions at once. "It is necessary ... to conceptualize 
    the contemporaneousness or coexistence of ... the two directions of time - 
    of the primitive peoples 'before' the State, and of the State 'after' the 
    primitive peoples - as if the two waves that seem to us to exclude or succeed 
    each other unfolded simultaneously in an 'archaeological', micropolitical, 
    micrological, molecular field." (ATP 431) (For more on this, see Note 15 below). 
    Universal history is a history from the point of view of capitalism's "vague" 
    Chronos; it is therefore always "parodic" because, as we have seen, capitalism 
    deletes all "intrinsic code" in favour of a mobile and variable set of axioms. 
    Parodic universal history is profoundly "anti evolutionist" because it describes 
    the simultaneous and coextensive interaction of ostensibly successive social 
    regimes. From the start, the two "previous" social regimes (the primitive 
    socius and the despotic state) anticipate and ward off capitalism's "diachronic 
    time" - "capitalism has haunted all forms of society" (AO, 140) - even though 
    it supposedly comes "at the end". </font>

    11. In Structural Anthropology 1, Levi-Strauss makes an important point in 
    this regard. "Not only Sophocles, but Freud himself, should be included among 
    the recorded versions of the Oedipus myth, on a par with earlier, or seemingly 
    more 'authentic' versions." (217) Reconstructions of myths don't function 
    extrinsically or transcendently, as final "interpretations", but operate immanently, 
    recursively adding more skeins to the fictive webwork. If there is no outside 
    of fiction, it is not because of some transcendental universal-textuality, 
    but because fiction cannot be contained by texts; it is already Outside. (L.T.)

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    13. "Near the edge of the plateau and due east of the Second Pyramid, with 
    a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of Khephren, its royal 
    restorer, stands the monstrous Sphinx - mute, sardonic and wise beyond mankind 
    and memory." (Lovecraft, 241). Lovecraft puts the question that seems to plague 
    the authors of "Flatlines": "... what huge and loathsome abnormality was the 
    Sphinx originally carven to represent?" (258) Needless to say, there have 
    been countless speculations on the nature and origin of the Sphinx, but these 
    are inconclusive and contradictory, no doubt because its "huge and loathsome 
    abnormality" will have always exceeded any attempt to represent it. Many scholars 
    (see for instance, Lowell Edmunds, "The Sphinx in the Oedipus Legend") now 
    believe that the Sphinx element in the Oedipus narrative was actually a later 
    addition to an already existing mythic system, even though the Egyptian Sphinx 
    is evidently much older than the Greek culture that has given us the Oedipus 
    myth with which we are familiar. (It should be remembered that the encounter 
    with the Sphinx is not dramatised in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex; it is referred 
    to as something that has already happened.) The attempt to date the Sphinx 
    has produced widely different speculations; with certain - controversial - 
    estimations claiming that the Sphinx is "even older than 15,000 B.C." (Hancock 
    448) With Deleuze and Guattari, though, we might want to suggest that (in 
    at least one sense) Oedipus is as old as humanity, and that the Sphinx - as 
    that which must be destroyed in order that humanity may exist - would inevitably 
    always have to be narrated as something preceding the human. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    Levi-Strauss links the Sphinx to other "cthonian beings", such as the dragon. 
    Like the dragon, "the Sphinx is a monster unwilling to permit men to live." 
    (215) While some, such as Carlo Ginzburg, connect the Sphinx with death ("the 
    Sphinx is undoubtedly a mortuary animal" [228]), Levi-Strauss argues that 
    Sphinx-myths concern "the autocthonous origin of man", the idea that human 
    individuals are born direct from the Earth (rather than through meiotic reproduction). 
    (Ginzburg notes that Oedipus is "a cthonic hero.") The Sphinx would then correspond 
    to what Deleuze and Guattari call "biocosmic memory." "Man must constitute 
    himself through the repression of the intense germinal influx, the great biocosmic 
    memory" (AO 190) = Oedipus must riddle the sphinx. In a sense, then this biocosmic 
    memory "precedes" the organism (which emerges simultaneously with death and 
    sexuation) . But, as both "Weismannism" and the Dogon myths attest, this germinal 
    time persists, coterminously, alongside that of the organism (see AO 158). 
    This may explain a puzzling feature of the Oedipus myth as it has reached 
    us; to wit, why does a creature of such incredible power as the Sphinx allow 
    itself to be riddled so easily? As Velikovsky puts it: "It has been observed 
    that the answer Oedipus gave was on the level of a schoolboy and that the 
    monster must have been feeble-minded to leap from the precipice upon hearing 
    it. And why should a winged sphinx die in a jump?" (207) The answer would 
    be that the Sphinx doesn't die (it cannot, since it does not live), and that 
    it takes advantage of Oedipus' unwarranted Self-belief only in order to invade 
    Civilization, hidden. Which would also imply that the answer Oedipus gives 
    to the riddle is inadequate. Or partial. (L.T.) </font>

    14. Like the shaman "before" him, the Pharaoh occupies the line of deterritorialiazation 
    for the socius. He is thus able to ensure that all lines of escape are reterritorialized 
    on his own body. "The full body as socius has ceased to be the earth, it has 
    become the body of the despot, the despot himself or his God. The prescriptions 
    and prohibitions that often render him almost incapable of acting make of 
    him a body without organs ." (AO, 194) </font>

    the whispered furtive words, smelling for the sweat of guilty fear." (104)

    18. "No doubt the war machine is realized more completely in the 'barbaric' 
    assemblages of nomadic warriors than in the 'savage' assemblages of primitive 
    societies." (ATP, 359) This does not mean, however, that the war machine can 
    be equated with the Barbarians. Nomadism is not a question of belonging to 
    a particular population, but of maintaining particular practices. "The nomad 
    distributes himself in smooth space; he occupies, inhabits, holds that space; 
    that is his territorial principle." (ATP, 381) The barbarians, who leave the 
    Steppes, no longer occupy the smooth space of nomos. The war machine is necessarily 
    captured the moment it leaves the desert: "nomads have a specificity that 
    is too hastily reduced to its consequences, by including them in the empires 
    or counting them among the migrants..." (ATP, 410) </font>

    20. Etymologically, of course, the name Oedipus means "swollen foot." Velikovsky, 
    however, argues that there is a case for reading it as "swollen leg." "In 
    folklore feet may stand for legs. Many languages do not have different words 
    for legs and feet. In Greek, the word pous stands for both; in Egyptian, too, 
    the word r-d (foot) stands also for leg. In the riddle that Oedipus solved 
    concerning the creature that walks on four legs, on two, and on three ..., 
    the Greek word used is pous, and thus the name Oedipus could, and even preferably 
    so, mean 'swollen legs.'" (Velikovsky, 57) </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    21. Velikovsky argues that the Oedipus myth has been transposed from Egypt 
    (which also has a city called Thebes). Oedipus, he suggests, was originally 
    a Pharaoh named Akhnaton. In contemporary depictions, Akhnaton's "most pronounced 
    malformation [was] the shape of his thighs; they are swollen." (55) </font>

    22. It should be pointed out that, strictly speaking, there is no prehistory; 
    prehistory is myth of the State. As we have already seen (see Note 10), from 
    the start the primitive socius anticipates and wards off both capitalism and 
    the State: "primitive societies are fully inside history." (AO, 151) By the 
    same token, though, the very fact that primitive societies are inside history 
    means that they are not nomadic. "It is true that nomads have no history; 
    they only have a geography." (ATP, 393) </font>

    23. Carlo Ginzburg suggests that the foot mutilations Oedipus suffers in the 
    various versions of the legend may be references to shamanic initiation practices. 
    He also speculates that these may have concerned calendrical rituals (the 
    lameness indicating the imbalances necessary for certain calendric cycles 
    to function). It is mutilation that disappears with psychoanalysis, where 
    it is made to operate as a representation of psychical processes. Levi-Strauss 
    makes parallels between shamanism and psychoanalysis in Structural Anthropology 
    (198-202). Deleuze and Guattari would no doubt stress the way in which Freud's 
    neo(anti)shamanism doubly reduces Oedipal mutilation, to metaphor, and to 
    function. The question (posed in a number of ways throughout Anti-Oedipus) 
    then becomes: how did the body construct a theatrical unconscious for which 
    gouging out eyes 'equals' castration, and castration simply subtracts hedonic 
    function? </font>

    24. Eliade gives many examples of the use of iron in shamanic initiation rites. 
    For example: "The candidate's limbs are removed and disjointed with an iron 
    hook; the bones are cleaned, the flesh scraped, the body fluids thrown away, 
    and the eyes torn from its sockets." (Eliade, 1988, 36) It is important to 
    distinguish the strategic and subordinate use of metal in "the primitive socius" 
    from the war machine's necessary and intrinsic relation to metallurgy. "AXIOM 
    III. The Nomad war machine is the form of expression, of which itinerant metallurgy 
    is the correlative form of content."(ATP 415) The war machine populates the 
    metal body, while the primitive socius accesses it only intermittently through 
    the lone journeys of the shaman. </font>

    25. Cthelll designates the infernal nether regions referred to in numerous 
    mythologies of the Underworld. It refers particularly to the molten, metallic 
    inner core of the earth. In his book on alchemy, The Forge and the Crucible, 
    Eliade makes much of the connections between metallurgy, the core of the earth 
    and shamanism. Here and in Shamanism, Eliade reinforces Deleuze and Guattari's 
    view of the smith as an ambiguous figure, aligned neither with sedentary societies 
    nor with nomadic distributions but performing an essential function for both. 
    Deleuze and Guattari write of "the double theft and double betrayal of the 
    metallurgist who shuns agriculture at the same time as animal-raising." (ATP 
    414) (Another interesting connection in this regard is that between Oedipus 
    and the smith. Deleuze and Guattari refer to Oedipus as "the Greek Cain" [ATP, 
    125], whilst elsewhere strongly linking Cain with the figure of the smith 
    [ATP, 414]). For Eliade, the relationship between the smith and the shaman 
    is close - "'Smiths and shamans are from the same nest'" - but often unstable: 
    "According to the Dolgan, shamans cannot 'swallow' the souls of the smiths 
    because smiths keep their souls in the fire; on the other hand, a smith can 
    catch a shaman's soul and burn it. In their turn, the smiths are constantly 
    threatened by evil spirits." (470) </font>

    26. The shaman's occupation of the line of deterritorialization plays a crucial 
    role in maintaining the "dynamic equilibrium" (AO, 151) of the primitive socius; 
    delirium never becomes collective. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd"> 
    27. Hunter-gatherers populate a smooth space, but only by organizing upon 
    it. "The primitive machine subdivides the people but does so on an undivided 
    earth." (AO, 151) Once again, this is to be differentiated from the war machine, 
    which populates an undivided earth with a molecular multiplicity. </font>

    28. "The Sphinx was an oracle, and therefore she was supposed to answer questions, 
    not to ask them. Yet it is also true that oracular answers were often given 
    in the form of a riddle that required interpretation, usually supplied by 
    priests attending the oracle... It does not seem to me that every question 
    needs - or has - an answer... But were it my misfortune to stand before the 
    Sphinx with the dire prospect of never entering Thebes, I should reply to 
    her riddle: 'It is Oedipus' ... An oracle's questions and answers refer to 
    the man who stands before it. Oedipus was exposed, a helpless infant with 
    damaged feet, to crawl in the wasteland; he grew to be a man and a hero; his 
    end was that of a blind wanderer in exile." (Velikovsky, 207) "The parechesis 
    at Soph. even suggests that it was the deformity of Oedipus' feet that gave 
    him the clue to the answer; and there was a tradition that Oedipus gave the 
    answer by pointing to himself." (Edmunds, 160) </font>
