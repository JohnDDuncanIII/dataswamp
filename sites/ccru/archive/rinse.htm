    Sinofuturism is a darkside cartography of the turbulent rise of East Asia. 
    It connects seemingly heterogeneous elements onto the topology of planetary 
    capitalism. On digital maps sent back from Shaolin (a satellite entity orbiting 
    somewhere outside history) the modern Occident appears as irrigated through 
    a modernity of thermodynamic industrialist aggression. When the modern nation-state 
    bought its war machines, splitting a constitutive power into a double articulation 
    between political aims and militarised means, it adopted a state-centred martial 
    mode. But the regulation/prohibition of means has, for a long time, been known 
    as the best recipe for turbulence- control as a catalyst of non-linearity. 
    It was not surprising, therefore, when the means (through unprecedented investment 
    in constant and variable capital), in a flash, emerged from the depths of 
    the strata, dragging with it the intestines that had held it in place, pulling 
    the inside of the State onto the outside. Thereby Clausewitz's formula was 
    reversed, relegating component States into mere conduits for a planetary military-cybernetic 
    machine. Phase change. Programmed catastrophe surfing on pure war. Turbulence 
    simulation. A war against positive feedback &quot;quantizing it as amplification 
    within an unvariable metric. . .[and] . . .establishing a cybernetics of stability 
    fortified against the future.&quot;6 Postmodern control is based on the undecidable 
    proposition because, after the Absolute Peace of the Cold war, the enemy to 
    the human security system is a polytendrilled abomination (into which the 
    state is always becoming) of transnational trade, warlords, narco-syndicates 
    and millenial death cults. At this precise point, Sun Tzu rushes in from Shaolin, 
    with tactical cuts on the CNS of the Occidental megamachine as it mutates 
    into informational ice.7 </font></p>

    &quot;The modern Human Security System might even have appeared with Wiener's 
    subliminal insight that everything cyberpositive is an enemy of mankind. Evolving 
    out of a work on weaponry guidance systems, his was an attempt to enslave 
    cybernetics to a general defence technology against alien invasion. Cybernetics 
    was itself to be kept under control, under a control that was itself not cybernetic. 
    It was as if his thinking were guided by a blind tropism of evasion, away 
    from another, deeper, runaway process: from a technics losing control and 
    a communication with the outside of man.&quot;8 </font></p>

    Cut. When Wiener sanctifies Leibniz as the don of cybernetics for animating 
    the triadic geometricism of Spinoza's Ethics, he wages war on the outside. 
    Wiener's Cybernetics consisted of on-off electrical switches, a Boolean algebra 
    of classes based on the yes-no of inside or outside a class. The crucial point 
    of convergence was Leibniz's elucidation of the binary counting system. When 
    Leibniz had developed this he sent some transcripts to his Jesuit correspondent 
    in China, Bouvet. In return, Bouvet sent Leibniz a copy of the I Ching thinking 
    he would be amazed to see that his binary system had been circulating for 
    millennia. Leibniz was so affected. So affected as to hallucinate it as evidence 
    as some kind of universalist triumph. He re-routes Creation through a neo-Confucianist 
    I Ching of binary arithmetic. &quot;I think the substance of the ancient theology 
    of the Chinese is intact and, purged of additional errors, can be harnessed 
    to the great truths of Christian religion.&quot;9 It would seem therefore 
    that Leibniz organizes Spinoza's substance as Confucius codes the tao. Neo-Confucianism 
    becomes the mega-organism of the monadology, with God as the binary machine 
    of the yin-yang, while hiding a darkside cosmic cartography of the matrix, 
    Spinoza's substance or the machinic phylum. (It should be noted that Deleuze's 
    Leibniz is more resilient, a organicism taken to such psychedelic extremes 
    that it takes merely a nudge to open it out onto a topology of morals; the 
    monadology unfolds into the nomadology) </font></p>

    Shaolin takes the I Ching for software assigning the number 3 as the immobile 
    motor of the encryption system. In the I Ching, the hexagramic production 
    process involves a chaotic flow of numbers. A trigram involves 2 machinic 
    components; rigid, unbroken lines; supple, broken lines. The rigid and broken 
    lines correspond to yang and yin respectively. Either of these lines can be 
    lines of becoming in that period of transition which makes it impossible to 
    speak of the yin-yan as dialectic. Trigrams or gua are composed of three lines 
    stacked upon each other. In piles of 3, the possible configurations are 23=8. 
    Around these lines function a 64 (82) piece system comprised of all the possible 
    permutations. A hexagram cartography maps the non-linear dynamics of exteriority; 
    self-organization in smooth space, the onset of turbulence and the folding 
    of stratification.10 As with a computer, the I Ching samples the actual and 
    runs it through a binary system- in materialist hyper-reality, simulation 
    is not a loss of the real (a postmodern idealist nihilism) but the intervention 
    of the virtual (reality) into the actual (reality). Reality is always a machinic 
    production. </font></p>

    Oriental and Occidental stratification meet on the plane of organisation. 
    According to Wiener, Leibniz &quot;replaces the pair of corresponding elements, 
    mind and matter, by a continuum of corresponding elements, the monads. While 
    these are conceived after the pattern of the soul, they include many instances 
    which do not rise to the degree of self-consciousness of full souls, and which 
    form part of that world which Descartes would have attributed to matter. Each 
    of them lives in its own closed universe, with a perfect causal chain from 
    the creation or from minus infinity in time to the indefinitely remote future; 
    but closed though they are, they correspond one to the other through the pre-established 
    harmony of God. Leibniz compares them to clocks which have which have been 
    wound up as to keep time together from the creation for all eternity. Unlike 
    humanly made clocks, they do not drift into asynchronism; but this is due 
    to the miraculously perfect workmanship of the creator.&quot;11 Like Hobbes' 
    Leviathan, where the Man-State is an organism (with the embryonic bourgeois 
    monetary capillary system as irrigated network of blood), Wiener points out 
    how in Leibniz's fractal monadology his &quot;treatment of the living organism 
    [as]. . . really a plenum, wherein other living organisms, such as the blood 
    corpuscles, have their life&quot; runs along that same plane; &quot;scarcely 
    more than a philosophical anticipation of the cell theory, according to which 
    most of the animals and plants of moderate size and all those of large dimensions 
    are made up of units, cells, which have many if not all the attributes of 
    independent living organism. . .building bricks of organisms of a higher stage.&quot;12

    East-West co-stratification. Twined. Organisms on every scale. For non-organic 
    or machinic desire, exterior to any system of transgression, law or lack, 
    &quot;PODS= Politically Organized Defensive Systems. Modelled upon the polis, 
    pods hierarchically delegate authority through public institutions, family 
    and self, seeking metaphorical sustenance in the corpuscular fortifications 
    of organisms and cells. The global human security allergy to cyberrevolution 
    consolidates itself in the New World Order, or consummate macropod, inheriting 
    all the resources of repression as concrete collective history.&quot;13 </font></p>

    &quot;The last organs fall off leper earth revealing sockets of mangled circuitry 
    and coagulated blood dispersing out through transcarcerative planomenal veins- 
    drug rush, energy rush, artillery through the arteries.&quot;14 &quot;Heroin 
    goes triadic, the veins ice over and crack.&quot;15 Carried along by the breakbeats 
    of a cosmic secret numeracy, a whole darkside network of trade and relays 
    from the Orient infiltrate the Occident. An intricate system of cuts, sinofuturism 
    is the acupuncture of the West into planetary schizophrenia. &quot;The transfer 
    from Empire of China to Empire of the Self is never ending.&quot;16 </font></p>

    &quot;Five hundred years of modernity fades when the weaving of bamboo mats 
    converges with the manufacture of computer games in the streets of Bangkok, 
    Taipei, and Shanghai. The silicon links were already there.&quot;17 Cybernetics 
    is not just about technical machines. Information warfare is not just about 
    cyberspace. Its fundamental element is virtual reality, but an array of practical 
    religions have been surfing it for many millenia. This is perhaps why so much 
    of the 'new science' of complexity is ceaselessly converging with the cosmic 
    materialism of Voodoo, Tantrism, Zen and the Chinese martial arts, pointing 
    to non-Western influences on cybernetics, and the emergent lines of a future, 
    beyond the pale.18 Situated on this continuum, information warfare is stripped 
    down to a war of perceptions, hacking, jamming and stealth tactics in the 
    nervous system, whether it be planetary telecommercial networks or the human 
    organism. As Virilio puts it, &quot;[w]eapons are tools not just of destruction 
    but also of perception- that is to say, stimulants that make themselves felt 
    through chemical, neurological processes in the sense organs and the central 
    nervous system, affecting human reactions and even the perceptual identification 
    and differentiation of objects.&quot;19 It is in this respect that narcotics 
    can be considered as &quot;a soft plague infecting the nervous system of commodity 
    cybernetics. . .A global capitalism fighting its own drugs markets is a horror 
    auto-toxicus, an auto-immune disease. Drug control is the attempt by the human 
    species to control the uncontrollable; control escalation itself, tropisms 
    programmed by the aliens. The human security apparatuses experiment with drugs 
    as weapons and tools, their soldiers are stoned, energised, and anaesthetised 
    on a range of prescribed and proscribed pharmaceuticals. Their irregular forces 
    are subsidised by narcotics revenue. The war against drugs is a war on drugs.&quot;20 
    For Paul Virilio, Sun Tzu is a rumbling undercurrent. In fact it is Sun Tzu 
    who invents his notion of Pure war, meditating in Shaolin for two and a half 
    millenia waiting for its actualisation in military cybernetics. The reason 
    why The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a tool-box for the 'cutting edge' of cybernetic 
    capitalism, from business to military strategists, is that it contains an 
    abstract flow chart or a fluid physics for survival 'far from equilibrium,' 
    a tactics for turbulence. Camouflage. Imperceptibility. Speed. &quot;Be so 
    subtle that you are invisible. Be so Mysterious that you are intangible. Then 
    you will control your rivals' fate.&quot;21 </font></p>

    &quot;Neo China arrives from the future.&quot;22 Or has been arriving ever 
    since it was by-passed by European militarized capital, despite a much stronger 
    degree of technological development. As Manuel Da Landa puts it, &quot;the 
    Europe of 1494 was in a process of 'solidification,&quot; as if the different 
    political entities that comprise Europe had existed in a fluid form and were 
    now crystallizing into a solid shape. In contrast with rival empires (Chinese, 
    Ottoman), which for reasons of geography and religion had developed a mostly 
    uniform 'crystal,' Europe never solidified into one piece, but rather into 
    a broken conglomerate with shifting boundaries. As 'stress' built up along 
    those cracks and fissures, it was relieved in the form of armed conflict following 
    the lines of least resistance. And it was indeed the dynamical nature of the 
    'broken crystal' that allowed Western Societies to surpass China and Islam 
    in the competition to conquer the world.&quot;23 </font></p>

    Slow release protracted war run from Shaolin; Shaolin is swarm catalyser, 
    programming Triad syndicated film production in Hong Kong, golden triangle 
    poppy production, Kowloon chemical distillation and encrypted planetary distribution 
    networks rinsing out global finance in San Franciscan Laundromats. Shaolin 
    orchestration of the golden triangle turns the Opium War against itself through 
    those intricate incisions, routes opened by numeric rhythms in continuous 
    variation. Chinese narcotic syndicates operate on the darkside of the guanxi 
    rhizome of Chinese informal trading markets. Secret cartography. Secret money. 
    Secret composition. Unknown chemicals to rewire the nervous systems for the

    As Sterling Seagrave points out, sino-futurism is less an issue of the Chinese 
    state in future core conflict (not that this is not of massive importance 
    to the trajectory of the world system) but the vast overseas population which 
    runs South East Asia and produces internal souths in Occidental megalopian

    A symbiotics of markets and anti-markets, narco-capital twists prohibition 
    against itself through escalative waves of mass addiction beyond control. 
    What brings states into complementary relation with crime syndicates is those 
    kleptocratic elements which operate as an anti-market- territorial protectionism 
    and the exortion of rent. Protection is a mini-despotic service, a vernacular

    evolutions to make all evolutionism crumble.&quot;26 Running a tendential 
    system from the territorialized and coded earth to the decoding and deterritorializing 
    planet, capitalism is seen to retro-chronically rework the whole of history 
    which is composed of a co-existing continuum of rigid lines, broken lines 
    and line of becoming, with their corresponding modes of social segmentarity, 
    regimes of signs, modes of numeracy, and relation to speed (space-time). It 
    constitutes not historical resolution but a descent into the maelstrom, down 
    the spiralling slopes into the matrix. But neither does the New World Disorder 
    become the substitute telos of social transformation. &quot;From the standpoint 
    of a whimsical evolutionism according to which packs are lower on the scale 
    and are superseded by the State or familial societies. On the contrary there 
    is a difference in nature. The organization of packs is entirely different 
    from that of families and states: they continually work them within and trouble 
    them from without, with other forms of content, other forms of expression.&quot;27

    The onset of turbulence. From molecular streams seeping from the damms of 
    Occidental ice to high bandwidth cables plugged straight into the heart of 
    the jungle, pumping alternating currents of cocaine, opium, guns, cash and 
    information into the warped strataplex of the core. A planomenal jungle topology 
    traced as a tropical geometry of golden crescents and triangles feeding the 
    internal south. &quot;Narcotic trade as guerrilla swarmachine. Becoming imperceptible, 
    Becoming flea. . .but territorial fleas. Dog fleas. Subterranean networks 
    of molecular distribution, deterritorializing the apparatus of statist commodity 
    control, but reterritorializing as micro-statist oedipal organized crime syndicates. 
    Statist and micro-statist Drug Enforcement Agencies in ostensible opposition, 
    White economies vs. Black markets, poles of mutually legitimately cybernetic 
    interaction operating territorial protectionism.&quot;28 The internal south 
    is not neo-primitive but does breed modes of collectivity of the band, pack 
    or gang type. In Capitalism &amp; Schizophrenia, the primitive machine is 
    coded and territorialized on the earth. But its supple segmentarity, its mechanisms 
    put in place to ward off tendencies of stratification are not confined to 
    hunter-gathering societies. That is to say, its abstract machine is not underdeveloped, 
    disorganized or tied to the infancy of history. The permutations of segmentarity 
    are stretched out on a virtual continuum of coexistence. The BWO is the sample 
    bank out of which history extracts its flows. It is the engine which makes 
    the social flee all over the place. And this is why Paul Virilio, in Speed 
    &amp; Politics, describes the function of the police as 'highway patrol'29 
    , the regulation of escape velocities, a tendential calculus manufacturing 
    homeostasis. Axiomatics. The Unspecified Enemy. Propositions Undecidable. 
    On this continuum, banditry, piracy, gangs, police and State war machines 
    are merely differences in consistency, composition and speed. This topology 
    twists the traditional theory of organized crime upside down. Instead of the 
    pyramidal Mafia hierarchy run by the mini-despot who orchestrates the tendrils 
    of the black market with political corruption and the threat of violence, 
    the abstract machine of (dis)organised crime works bottom up along the lines 
    of viral contagion and auto-immune response. Markets resonate in anti-markets.

    Chinese crime syndicates are not nomad war machines. There is too much engagement 
    in micro-fascism for that. But its blade politics generate accidental effects 
    crucially in distinction from the fascist morality of the scalpel. Instead 
    of the lancing of cancerous growths on the social body, their incisions into 
    the Occident accelerates trade through the protective shell of the Western 
    Bodily Organization. (WBO)30 But even in Shaolin the mission was always ambivalent, 
    assisting the Empire in fighting off the invading Eleuth Mongols (and after 
    World War II, against the Mao's guerrilla swarmachine), while maintaining 
    a secret organization always in tension with the imperial bureaucracy. </font></p>

    An entwined composition oscillating between mega and war machinic modes. Undoubtedly, 
    it is the war machinic threads that prove educational to sinofuturism. For 
    Deleuze &amp; Guattari, the war machine is diagrammed by an occult numeracy 
    which forges secret pathways, imperceptible to the eye of power. Between the 
    nomad war machine and the apparatus of capture, &quot;[t]he issue is not at 
    all anarchy versus organization, not even centralism versus decentralisation, 
    but a calculus or conception of the problems of nondenumerable sets, against 
    the axiomatic of denumerable sets.&quot;31 In opposition to the numbered number 
    which measures the movement of bodies in space, the numbering number lubricates 
    collective vectors through layers of social sedimentation. Nomad numeracy 
    is an abstract engine giving a distributed population a dynamic consistency- 
    swarmachinic encryption. For illegal syndicates and guerrilla groups morphological 
    fluidity are essential. In the &quot;war machine and nomadic existence, the 
    number is no longer numbered, but becomes a Cipher, and it is this capacity 
    that it constitutes the 'esprit de corps' and invents the secret and its outgrowths 
    (strategy, espionage, war ruses, ambush, diplomacy etc.&quot;32 </font></p>

    Triad organisation engages a coding system at odds with that of the state,

    as one distributes something in space, instead of dividing up space or distributing 
    space itself. The number becomes a subject. The independence of the number

    of smooth space, which is occupied without being counted. The number is no 
    longer a means of counting but of moving.&quot;33 Cosmic secrecy requires

    secret handshake is a transversal interlock, disengaging professional masks 
    to conduct a darkside flow of cash, information, software, electronics hardware, 
    narcotics and weaponry. &quot;When the lodge father had accepted Piet's tea 
    and Yung's salute, he stood to attention placing his left hand slightly below 
    his chest with thumb, third and little fingers out- stretched. His index and 
    fourth fingers were bent under his palm. It was the secret sign which only 
    a lodge father may use. Yung Ming replied by putting his own hand on the identical 
    portion of his body, the thumb and the little finger outstretched and the 
    other three fingers kept tucked beneath the palm. He thereby returned the 
    secret sign of a branch leader. Then they bowed deeply to each other.&quot;

    &quot;To the Triads the number 3 is of central significance, both mathematically 
    and mystically: 3 multiplied by 3 (3 squared) equals 9; and any number that 
    adds up to 9 is divisible by 9. For example: 1,804,563, which reduces to 9 
    by adding all the digits together (27) and then adding the result together 
    (2+7=9). To the Chinese, 3 is the mystical number denoting the balance between 
    Heaven, Earth and Man. . .&quot;35 Triadic machine coding attributes to each 
    officer-rank a numerical code which begins with a four. Basic members are 
    known as SzeKau or 49s. Shan Chu is 489; the Fu Shan Chu, Heung Chu, Sin Fung 
    and Sheung Fa officers (all equal in rank) are 438; the Hung Kwan is 426; 
    Pak Tsz Sin is 415; Cho Hai is 432. Lodge leaders are termed 489s and also 
    21s (4+8+9). 21 is also 3(number of creation) multiplied by 7 (both the number 
    of death and lucky number); the coding encrypted into the leader therefore 
    inscribes the abstract machine or phase space of the whole system in actuality. 
    Also significant, the incense Master, 438, is 15 (4+3+8); 3 multiplied by 
    5, or creation and longevity/preservation maps onto his function in lodge 
    ritual as conductor of future-history. The internal consistency of this numeracy 
    is significant in that it offers a mode of composition lubricating the movement 
    of bodies in space, through jungles to covert chemical/software factories 
    to towering mega-corporations as accountants, lawyers, stockbrokers, and most 
    notably the police itself. For as Martin Booth points out, &quot;a Triad lodge 
    rarely has a permanent location.&quot;36 Interpol once described the Triad 
    structure as a several storied building in which the inhabitants of one floor 
    don't know where the stairs are to the next floor.&quot;37 Despite global 
    reach, the Triads vary from other syndicates in that, while Hong Kong, especially 
    after return to China, serves as catalytic HQ, there is no overreaching administration. 
    Globally, the three most powerful factions are the 14K, the Sun Yee On and 
    the Wo Hop To. Each lodge is for the most part autonomous even from other 
    14K lodges for example. Difficult to penetrate, subterranean imperceptibility 
    has a long history for gangs associated with the ancient martial arts. </font></p>

    Opium was not a problem for China until Occidental infiltration in the late 
    18th and 19th centuries38 . China had much that the West desired (tea, silk, 
    cotton, spices and rice). England, the major mercantile force of the period 
    had to pay for goods in silver bullion which fluctuated wildly in terms of 
    price and supply. Through East India Company opium injected through the skin, 
    the direction of trade reversed as the drug seeped into every pore. Meanwhile 
    in Hong Kong, all the major financial institutions which persist today were 
    instituted on the loot- Dent &amp; Co., Butterfield &amp; Swire, Hutchison 
    &amp; Co. and Jardine, Mathesons &amp; Co. As Martin Booth tells us, &quot;all 
    these firms were founded on opium.&quot;39 The taxation on opium trade imposed 
    by the Chinese government generated the underground network subsequently ploughed 
    by the Triads who made almost as much money as the English did40 . &quot;When 
    in 1915, the British ceased importing opium into China, the French continued 
    to traffic and began cultivating their own sources of supply in north-western 
    Vietnam and eastern Laos. French advisors made contact with the Meo and Yao 
    hill tribes, teaching them to grow harvest and market opium and thus was the 
    Golden Triangle born. . .The basis for all of this was of course silver. During 
    1837, for example, the British sent 2.4 million kilograms of opium to China. 
    Each kilo of opium was worth five taels of silver thus, approximately 10 million 
    taels of silver were transmitted abroad in a single year.&quot;41 </font></p>

    &quot;In the latter half of the T'ang dynasty a growing tea commerce between 
    the south and the imperial capital began to underscore the necessity for convenience 
    to exchange. In response, a medium poetically named 'flying money' (fei-ch'ien) 
    evolved. Provincial governors maintained 'memorial offering courts' at the 
    capital. Southern merchants paid the money they made from the sale of goods 
    at the capital to these courts, which then used it to pay the tax quotas due 
    from the Southern provinces to the central government. In return, the courts 
    issued the merchant with a certificate. When the merchant returned home, he 
    presented this certificate to the provincial government and was paid an equivalent 
    sum of money. Thus did both the merchant and the local government avoid the 
    risk and inconvenience of carrying quantities of copper or silk.&quot; 42

    Fei ch'ien rinse out. Extensive underground banking networks running through 
    gold shops, trading companies and money changers, where record keeping procedures 
    are virtually non-existant, and trade takes on the camouflage of coded chit 
    messages, simple telephone transfers and nested systems of coding encrypted 
    for travel in cyberspace. &quot;One Hong Kong police official has stated that 
    he once seized a piece of paper with the picture of an elephant on it that 
    represented the collection receipt for $3 million at a Hong Kong gold shop.&quot;43 
    Hong Kong has neither central bank nor currency exchange controls thus virtually 
    eliminating the possibility of tracing funds entering or leaving Hong Kong. 
    It is a financial secrecy jurisdiction whereby disclosure of data is illegal44 
    . Drug traffickers, like all good investors prefer to diversify their assets 
    and invest in legit business, concealing the hot link between globetrotting 
    funds and source crimes. A petri dish for breeding commercial war machines. 
    For example: &quot;First cash generated from importations to the US was moved 
    back to Honk Kong, where it was held in a number of bank accounts under false 
    names of individuals or businesses. The bank was BCCI. The approach appears 
    simple. Cash, usually in amounts of approximately US$1million, was taken to 
    a money transmission company in the US. The most often used was a company 
    called Piano, which is known for its Colombian cocaine connections. These 
    amounts were then transferred to Bankers Trust and simply transferred telegraphically 
    to the various Hong Kong BCCI accounts, one of which was sarcastically called 
    Launderland.&quot; 45 &quot;Overseas banks, left with piles of small bills, 
    then ship them back to the US in exchange for larger bills. . .[the] consistent 
    increase in US currency repatriated from Hong Kong to the US from 1982 to 
    the first half of 1984 strikingly correlated with the steady increase in Southeast 
    Asian heroin marketed in the US from 1981 to 1983. This volume of smaller-denomination 
    bills exceeds the total volume of all currency transactions with any European 
    country. . .and the flow of US currency from the US to HK is minimal when 
    compared to the reverse flow of US currency from Hong Kong. . .&quot;46 </font></p>

    When the battleground is in cyberspace, deception is not merely about masks, 
    but functions in numerical operations flat with the terrain. Money laundering 
    and secret crime societies were always waiting for the vast encryption system 
    that constitutes the Internet. Planetary electronic networks compress space-time 
    into vectors of pure speed, emanating a protean geography traversed by torrents 
    of electron flow coded into zeros and ones. From the darkside of the military-cybernetics 
    complex, cyberspace is a vast digital capital Laundromat facilitating short-circuits 
    through the ice of the world banking system of the New World Order. &quot;Money

    Euro-dread for the End of Man. As the CIA hacked into the jungle, cutting 
    its share of Golden Triangle opium (re-routing it into US ghettos in the first

    of White Man Face as his colonial damms collapse and floods wash away his

    the lips and mouth eaten away by disease. The disease spread, melting the 
    face into an ameboid mass in which the eyes floated, dull, crustacean eyes. 
    Slowly, a new face formed around the eyes. A series of faces, hieroglyphs, 
    distorted and leading to the final place where the human road ends, where 
    the human form can non longer contain the crustacean horror that has grown

    8. &quot;After many centuries of inspiring kingmakers, generals and spies, 
    Sun's message was lost on the nineteenth century's Clausewitz, Moltke, and 
    the iron generals of Total War, who were too fascinated by industrial technology, 
    military hardware, logistics, and sheer destructive power. . . Nevertheless, 
    much of what Clausewitz admired about Napoleon's use of paramilitary units, 
    surprise and evasion, probably came from the Corsican's early reading of the 
    first Western translation of Sun Tzu by JJ Amiot, a French Jesuit scholar 
    in China, which was in circulation in Paris when Napoleon was a young officer. 
    This preference for cleverness over brute force has earned Sun Tzu a prominent 
    place ever since on the bookshelves of diplomats, generals and corporate planners. 
    Filled with terse and provocative aphorisms, The Art of War is as closely 
    studied by Asian investors and businessmen today as it was earlier by Mao 
    Tse-tung Ho Chi-minh and Vo Nguyen Giap. The Japanese say 'Politics is business, 
    business is war.' If the market place is a battleground, requiring strategy 
    and tactics, Sun Tzu wrote the Bible.&quot; 45-46 in Seagrave, S. (1995) Lords

    11. In What Is Philosophy, Deleuze &amp; Guattari (perhaps spuriously) point 
    to the limit of the I Ching's relation to the plane of consistency by differentiating 
    the philosophical concept from the figure (which they argue lapses into a 
    tracing of Nature) &quot;Hexagrams are combinations of continuous and discontinuous 
    features deriving from one another according to the levels of a spiral that 
    figures the set of moments through which a transcendent descends. . .In a 
    sort of to-ing and fro-ing, Chinese thought inscribes the diagrammatic movements 
    of a Nature-thought on the plane, intensive ordinates of these infinite movements, 
    with their components in continuous and discontinuous features. But correspondences 
    like these do not rule out there being a boundary, however difficult it is 
    to make out. This is because figures are projections on the plane, which implies 
    something vertical or transcendent. Concepts, on the other hand, imply only 
    neighbourhoods and connections on the horizon. Certainly, as Francois Jullien 
    has already shown in the case of Chinese thought, the transcendent produces 
    an 'absolutization of immanence' through projection.&quot; 89-93 (1993) London: 
    Verso. This seems valid against Confucianism but highly questionable in relation 
    to a yin-positive Taoism and its sinofuturist guerrilla offshoots. <br>

    the legalization of the opium traffic and the imposition of conditions which 
    laid the foundations of later imperialism. In this important journalism, Marx 
    (despite the Hegelian entrapment into a dialectical vision of the unfolding 
    of European history) stakes his claim as early prophet of sinofuturism; &quot;It 
    may seem a very strange, and a very paradoxical assertion that the next uprising 
    of the people of Europe, and their next movement for republican freedom and 
    economy of Government, may depend more probably on what is now passing in 
    the Celestial Empire- the very opposite of Europe- than on any other political 
    cause that now exists- more even than on the menaces of Russia and the consequent 
    likelihood of a general European war. But yet it is no paradox, as all may 
    understand by attentively considering the circumstances of the case.&quot;

    was occupied with the Taiping rebels, the Triads were busy massing an army 
    in the south. They captured the port of Amoy and the important regional centre 
    of Shanghai. They also laid siege to Canton and Kweilin: but surprisingly 
    they did not consolidate these gains and in spite of their successes failed 
    to pose a serious threat to the Ch'ing throne. Why the Triads did not take 
    advantage of the situation and press home their gains remains a puzzle. Perhaps 
    they had lost the political will to do so, because by this time their criminal 
    interests had become extensive, involving the cultivation and sale of opium 
    outside the registered- and taxed- government network.&quot; Ibid. 12. <br>

    to popular opinion, the chit system does not originate through Chinese trading. 
    &quot;Chits are a colonial invention. The word 'chit' is itself the diminutive 
    of 'chitty', a word of Anglo-Indian origin borrowed from the Hindi Chitthi, 
    meaning a mark. From about the late seventeenth century the word crept into 
    English usage as meaning a note, pass or certificate given to a servant. The 
    chitty came to China in the 19th century by way of British custom. Foreign 
    residents in the treaty ports found handling strings of Chinese cash or silver 
    ingots a major inconvenience. In order to eliminate this inconvenience a system 
    was devised whereby; 'the salary of foreign employees was paid by check drawn 
    on the Chinese compradore, who then held the funds against which the employees 
    wrote 'chits'. . .memoranda acknowledged debts for retail transactions. These 
    were accepted by the shopkeeper and passed for collection to the firms compradore.&quot;
