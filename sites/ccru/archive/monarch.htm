    was a Ccru Meat Puppet</font></strong> - Justine Morrison </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    testament is intended as a warning. It is addressed to those whose eyes and 
    ears and minds can be opened. Hope lies with those people, those brave souls 
    who dare to look. And if my experiences have taught me anything, it is that 
    there is always hope - no matter how dark and desperate things may seem. Many, 
    many people around the world are learning to open their eyes. I know that 
    some of you here will open your eyes this evening. Don&#8217;t underestimate 
    your power and importance. With each new pair of eyes that can see, we grow 
    stronger, and the Evil retreats. It depends on not being looked at, on not 
    being seen for what it is.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    wouldn&#8217;t be here unless you had already question the Lie. So the fact 
    you here at all is a cause for hope.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
    of the things I will tell you will seem unbelievable at first. Many of you 
    will think that the events I will describe could not possibly have happened. 
    Some of you will think that I am crazy. You know what? That is exactly what 
    I would have thought a few years ago. Yes, that&#8217;s exactly what I would 
    have thought - even though many of those atrocious, unbelievable things had 
    already happened to me personally. You see, when something very atrocious 
    happens to you, you can&#8217;t remember it. You screen it out in order to 
    survive. That&#8217;s what they count on. They feed on your disbelief. They 
    want to make it impossible for you to believe that they exist at all. That&#8217;s 
    how they operate.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    is a critical time in our struggle. Things are dark and desperate now. Believe 
    me. Things are more dark and desperate than you could ever imagine. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
    are playing out on the biggest possible stage. The biggest possible: the whole 
    human race is at risk. I wish I was exaggerating.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    know, they are getting more and more sure of themselves. They are passing 
    messages on the grandest possible scale and they do not even feel the need 
    to encrypt them very much. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;It&#8217;s 
    better with the butterfly.&#8217; Can you imagine how I felt when I saw that 
    slogan for the first time? The biggest software company in the world announces 
    the upgrading its online network with a strapline that was specifically addressed 
    to me, whom they called Assassin 8. When I saw those words I just froze. Thankfully, 
    I have come so far in my recovery now that I did not succumb to panic. I realized 
    that this sign was as much a cause of hope as a reason to fear. They had gained 
    a new confidence in showing themselves. The war was entering another phase. 
    So be it. &#8216;It&#8217;s better with the butterfly.&#8217; Don&#8217;t 
    believe it for a second. It will be worse. Far, far worse.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    MSN8 campaign is a sign that my former handlers, a group calling itself the 
    Ccru, has taken control of the emerging planet-mind. This should make you 
    very scared indeed. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
    tale is easier to tell because of the brave and honest trailblazing done by 
    Cathy O&#8217;Brien. It is Cathy who has done most to expose the monstrous 
    evil of the Monarch program. Every American - in fact every concerned citizen 
    of the world - needs to read her book Trance-Formation of America. Presumably, 
    many of you are here today because you have already read it.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
    the benefit of those of you who haven&#8217;t read Cathy&#8217;s work, I must 
    pause and explain a little about what the Monarch Program is. Those who know 
    a little about it will have to excuse the fact that my initial explanation 
    of Monarch will be very short. Some might think it is misleadingly short. 
    Perhaps this is so. But to consider Monarch in all its aspects would take 
    much longer than the time I have available today. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    Monarch program is a mind control program. It is named after the Monarch butterfly, 
    because, just as the butterfly changes its form - metamorphoses - so the controllers 
    &#8216;trance-form&#8217; the mind and personality of their subjects. Monarch 
    recruits its victims when they are children, usually with the collusion of 
    their parents. It uses what is known as trauma-based mind control to condition 
    its victims. Very briefly, this involves subjecting the children to stimuli 
    so horrible, so overwhelming, that their psyche disintegrates. The children 
    cannot deal with what they have experienced, so their personality breaks down 
    into so-called &#8216;alters&#8217; - submerged fragmentary personae that 
    can be called up and trained by the controllers to carry out their evil purposes. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who 
    is behind this program? Well, it is known to have been operating in Nazi Germany 
    during the Third Reich, and later to have been adopted by an offshoot of the 
    CIA called MK Ultra. But these agencies are only masks for the forces - the 
    Satanic forces - that are really in control.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    question for which the whole world should demand an answer is this: Why does 
    Ccru refuse to acknowledge its history of Monarch Program involvement, even 
    today? <br>
    No doubt many of you will be asking, &#8216;what is Ccru?&#8217; Even those 
    of you who already know about Monarch might not yet know about Ccru and its 
    role within the program. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    knew nothing of Ccru until I came across the name in publicity material for 
    their &#8216;Syzygy&#8217; (or &#8216;occult twins&#8217;) festival in London. 
    The name &#8216;Ccru&#8217; was strangely familiar to me, and I had no idea 
    why. It was not merely familiar, it was powerfully and unpleasantly evocative. 
    The moment I saw the posters and leaflets, I felt disoriented and threatened 
    by an upwelling panic I couldn&#8217;t explain. That night I was tormented 
    by senseless, terrifyingly vivid dreams.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
    of the dreams took place in an immense, desolate cavern. I felt that I was 
    drugged, or restrained, or both. Either way, I could not move. The cavern 
    was very dark, lit only by candles, and I could see almost nothing apart from 
    row after row of symbols chalked onto the walls. This was unnerving enough, 
    but what still terrorized me when I awoke from the dreams were the horrible 
    sounds that resonated in the cavern: there was a disconcerting, continuous 
    chanting, but, worse than that, a deep moaning that seemed to issue from the 
    throat of some vast, unearthly creature.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
    dreams were so vivid that they did not seem like dreams at all. They seemed 
    more like someone else&#8217;s memories.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    I had every reason to flee this macabre phenomenon, I found that I could not. 
    Instead I was drawn inwards - as if I had a destined role to play.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    had originally planned to remain in London for only a week or so. But now 
    I decided to stay longer, until at least the start of the Syzygy festival. 
    In the end, it turned out that I stayed for the whole thing. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ccru&#8217;s 
    contributions to Syzygy had taken the form of nightly &#8216;rituals&#8217; 
    dedicated to what they openly called &#8216;demons&#8217;. Night after night, 
    the theme of &#8216;twins&#8217; and &#8216;twinning&#8217; recurred. At this 
    time, part of me still thought that this was still some kind of art prank. 
    But the nightly rituals and readings were performed with what appeared to 
    be total seriousness. And every day, after the official events finished, there 
    were long, involved discussions that lasted deep into the night. None of the 
    Ccru controllers ever seemed to sleep. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was in these discussion sessions that I learned more about the Ccru&#8217;s 
    belief systems. They claimed to be waging an endless war against the oppressive 
    forces of normal social existence. In general, they seemed wary and paranoid, 
    yet with me they seemed peculiarly trusting and eager to share their esoteric 
    knowledge, as if recognizing a long lost and sorely missed accomplice. In 
    fact, Ccru seized upon me with an eagerness that should have been distressing, 
    except my sense of judgment had already decayed too far for that. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
    claimed that ordinary social reality maintained the power of what they called 
    &#8216;Atlantean White Magic&#8217;, a kind of elite conspiracy which they 
    said had secretly controlled the planet for millennia. They claimed to traffick 
    with demons who had told them many secrets drawn from a &#8216;Lemurian&#8217; 
    tradition of &#8216;time-sorcery&#8217; that contained within itself everything 
    that was and will be. Lemuria was supposedly an ancient sorcerous culture 
    populated by nonhuman beings.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ccru 
    also said that they had been taught to count by a sea-beast called Nomo which 
    they had first summoned during an elaborate ritual with took place in Western 
    Sumatra. It was clear to me from the unspoken undercurrent that human sacrifice 
    had been involved, probably on a massive scale. Their apparent indifference 
    to such suffering fitted in with a general loathing for human existence itself. 
    They celebrated what they saw as the imminent destruction of humanity by the 
    forces of techno-capitalism.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Were 
    these just stories, or did they really believe in what they were saying? When 
    I pressed them on this, they never gave me a straight answer. They kept saying 
    that I needed to learn that reality was itself a type of fiction, that both 
    belief and disbelief had to be left behind. I realize now that this was part 
    of a deliberate strategy to mentally destabilize me.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
    the dead center of the Ccru system was the &#8216;Pandemonium Matrix&#8217;. 
    It is difficult to fully describe what this horrible thing is. It was only 
    later, when I had escaped Ccru&#8217;s influence, that its real nature was 
    made clear to me. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
    the Matrix amounted to was a list of the demon-creatures which the Lemurian 
    sorcerers had traded and made pacts with. More than that, the Matrix gave 
    the numerical codes and other protocols that the Lemurians had used to contact 
    these entities. I quickly learned the names and characteristics of many of 
    these beings. I noticed that one seemed to be invoked more frequently than 
    the others: Katak, a demon associated with terrible destruction and desolation. 
    Night after night I ingested this Ccru spiritual poison, not realizing - or 
    even really caring - how thoroughly it was insidiously eroding the basic fabric 
    of my being, calling to my own inner demons. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    didn&#8217;t know just how close I was to total destruction, and wouldn&#8217;t 
    have known, were it not for what had happened on the last night of Syzygy. 
    This night was devoted to what Ccru called a summoning; but it&#8217;s clear 
    to me now that it was some form of hideous black Mass. After it had drawn 
    to a close, I had a strong impulse to step outside for some fresh air. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
    outside, I was vaguely aware of two trenchcoated figures lingering in the 
    darkness. Then things started to happen quickly. Before I had time to react, 
    one of them had grabbed me, covering my mouth; at the same time, the other 
    pulled a hypodermic syringe from his coat pocket and quickly pushed it into 
    my arm. I realized immediately that they had drugged me.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sedated 
    but still conscious I was dragged for what seemed like hours through the alleys 
    of Vauxhall. Eventually we arrived at what appeared to be a warehouse of some 
    kind. I remembered being taken through a series of security doors, until finally 
    we entered a large basement area. It was here that I was to spend six months 
    of shattering revelation. My two rescuers, although it took me several weeks 
    to properly identify them as such, were twin brothers Viktor and Sergei Kowalsky, 
    who displayed all the heroism, nobility and truthfulness of modern knights. 
    They themselves had escaped from a Soviet mind-control facility controlled 
    by Russian Satanists. After years of being pursued by agents from the most 
    occult wing of the KGB, the Kowalskys set up the base in London and there 
    they waged their selfless crusade against the evil of Satanic mind control. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    months I spent in the Kowalskys deprogramming laboratory - they called it 
    a &#8216;safe room&#8217; - were undoubtedly the most illuminating of my life. 
    Their therapeutic regime included hypnosis, drugs, and electrical stimulation. 
    The Kowalskys explained that these techniques were aimed at recovering material 
    buried deep within my mind. They were specially designed to restore the identity 
    of what they described as &#8216;Monarch slaves&#8217;, a term that was then 
    completely new to me. The Kowalskys told me that they needed to access the 
    alternate personalities or &#8216;Alters&#8217; who had been with me since 
    childhood. They said that I had been subject to &#8216;pandemonium programming&#8217;, 
    a special variant of the Monarch system of personality disintegration, compartmentalization 
    and indoctrination. The particular numerical combinations of the Pandemonium 
    Matrix, the Kowalskys told me, had functioned as triggers for my suppressed 
    identity fragments.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
    warned me that digging down through these deeply-compacted layers of trauma 
    would produce inexpressible intensities of anguish. In telling me this they 
    were not exaggerating in the slightest. Over the following terrible months 
    I would discover that my memories were lies, my mind had literally ceased 
    to be my own, and that I had been possessed instead by alien commands, and 
    demons. Who had been doing this to me, and why? </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was only as my recovery work with the Kowalskys painfully advanced, step by 
    step, that I came to understand the sinister purpose that held me in its claws. 
    The Kowalskys explained that Ccru wasn't an acronym at all, but was actually 
    a version of the ancient West-Polynesian word Khru, meaning the Devil of Apocalypse. 
    Once I understood that they were really Satan worshippers a lot of other things 
    became much clearer. The supposed Lemurian system was really a name for all 
    the demons of hell.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ccru&#8217;s 
    role as agents of Satanic mind control explained the pedantically detailed 
    theory of trauma they had outlined to me and also their striking obsession 
    with twins. In the world in which Ccru operated, traumatism was the means 
    and twins the raw material. It was only by the most heroic and persistent 
    efforts that the Kowalskys had initiated me into this aspect of the phenomenon. 
    In particular, it took months for me to fully accept that what felt like vivid 
    personal memories were actually telepathic communications from the submerged 
    mental compartments of my missing Monarch twin. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    Kowalskys told me that my recent involvement with Ccru, far from being accidental, 
    was the final stage of a long entanglement with them and the forces they represented. 
    Recovered memories from my early childhood showed that Ccru had been covertly 
    directing the course of my entire life, education and process of psychological 
    maturation. I had been chosen from before birth, assigned to them by the ancient 
    breeding masters countless generations before and had undergone meticulous 
    lifelong training to perform a special mission. I shuddered at the thought 
    of what this mission would involve. The Kowalskys gradually brought me to 
    the terrible realization that my mission had already been accomplished - on 
    the very night of my rescue. They told me that, with my mission complete, 
    I had been scheduled for &#8216;retirement&#8217; only hours later. This retirement 
    would involve a long and protracted ceremonial death, to be followed by a 
    ritual devouring by the demon Katak. A physical death and then a soul death.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    what had my mission been?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
    the therapy progressed, I crossed a new threshold in my recovery, and became 
    subject to a new wave of horribly realistic dreams. It was in these dreams 
    that the awful truth about the mission was revealed.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
    began with a semi-familiar stranger leading me forcibly into the subterranean 
    labyrinth beneath a tropical island.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    violating me repeatedly in the butterfly position, he took me down into the 
    lepidoptera hall. It was long and narrow, walled by shelves of meticulously 
    numbered jars. Each jar contained a butterfly. At first I thought they were 
    preserved specimens, until I noticed them moving slightly, opening and closing 
    their wings. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;Why 
    don't they die?&#8217; I asked. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8216;They 
    can't die while the puppet lives,&#8217; he replied. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was then that I noticed, shocked, that he was standing behind himself. I heard 
    cryptic numerical chanting in the background. Then the rear figure commanded 
    &#8216;Do it now ...&#8217;<br>
    <br>
    The chanting had changed into the insistent words &#8216;Assassin 8 .... Assassinate.... 
    Assassin 8 ..... Assassinate .....&#8217;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    looked down and saw the number &#8216;8&#8217; was painted onto my chest in 
    blood.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
    I saw myself standing over a bloody corpse laid out upon some kind of sacrificial 
    altar. In a moment of sickening revelation, I recognized that the body was 
    that of William Gates III. Of course, my initial response was to deny the 
    possibility that I could be a murderer. Surely this was some sick fantasy? 
    Wasn&#8217;t Bill Gates manifestly alive and prosperous, even appearing frequently 
    on TV? The Kowalskys were forced to puncture this bubble of comforting illusion. 
    How likely was it that this was actually the true Bill Gates? The Kowalskys 
    taught me that the probability was indeed vanishingly insignificant. Not only 
    did they point out all the subtle distinguishing features so that after comparing 
    video images I could distinguish between Gates and his double with close to 
    one hundred percent accuracy, they also explained how for political reasons 
    Gates&#8217; continued existence had become impossible.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was then that I recalled how, every Syzygy night without fail, the same slightly 
    odd-looking middle-aged woman would attend, wearing a shapeless raincoat, 
    an unnatural blonde beehive, dark glasses and an ornate butterfly tiara. She 
    sat silently, observing proceedings, her features twisted into a cruel and 
    complacent smile. Recalling this mysterious visitor later, with the help of 
    the Kowalskys, I was able to strip away the disguise and realize who &#8216;she&#8217; 
    had been: none other than Microsoft mastermind Bill Gates, or more probably 
    his twin. On other occasions the Gates-entity wore different disguises in 
    order to attend Ccru meetings without attracting attention, yet he was never 
    without a butterfly jewel of some kind -- a tiepin, for instance, or a ring. 
    On one occasion he appeared masquerading as the black-snow bluesman Blind 
    Humpty Johnson. I intuitively felt it had to be him, but I could not see the 
    emblem anywhere. Eventually I chanced to glimpse into the left lens of his 
    expensive shades and saw, deep in the black mirror, a holographic butterfly 
    fluttering endlessly through the void. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    all made a terrible kind of sense, but, understandably, I reacted very badly 
    to the discovery. The Kowalskys told me that this was probably because Gates 
    had been involved with me in earlier episodes of satanic abuse and that recognizing 
    him had threatened to reactivate unbearable repressed memories. They told 
    me that it would help to acknowledge these previous encounters so that I could 
    begin the process of healing. In any case there was no longer any doubt about 
    the truth - Gates was dead, and I had murdered him.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
    Gates&#8217; death, Microsoft and Ccru had become one thing. I realized how 
    completely I had misunderstood the situation. Ccru had given every indication 
    of holding Gates in awe, following his instructions without question. Among 
    themselves they would use many affectionate names for him, such as &#8216;Dollar 
    Bill&#8217;, &#8216;the Gator&#8217; and &#8216;Gates of Pandemonium&#8217;. 
    He had seemed like a kind of father figure to them. How could the Ccru web-site 
    have come to generate some of the heaviest traffic on the web, without any 
    advertising or even word-of-mouth popularization, if not for the massive and 
    sustained support offered by Gates and Microsoft? Many web users report that 
    the Ccru site sometimes pops up spontaneously when using certain Microsoft 
    applications.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ccru 
    went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their close links with Gates 
    were never exposed, even going so far as to attack him publicly. Now, of course, 
    I saw that the very name &#8216;Syzygy&#8217; had been a cynical declaration 
    of black ritual assassination. One twin would kill another. This was typical 
    of the brazen Ccru style - years before Ccru had spoken of the &#8216;Switch&#8217;. 
    They had also publicly announced that the Age of Katak was arriving, when 
    the world would be consumed by blood and fire. The assassination of Gates 
    was supposed to initiate this new era. The Kowalskys explained that Gates 
    was the romanized version of the proto-Arabic Khatzeik, the form of the name 
    Katak as recorded on the Black Stele in the ruins of Irem. Killing Gates was 
    both a symbolic and a practical act that would enable Ccru to take control 
    of cyberspace and use it for the vast planetary hive-mind control system that 
    they are creating.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    letters MSN followed by the butterfly icon signifies Mission Butterfly, or 
    Monarch Program. I never really understood their numbo-jumbo, but they showed 
    me that MSN8 was qabbalistically equivalent to CCRU - I can&#8217;t remember 
    how it worked now, but it was very persuasive at the time.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
    the MSN8 campaign broke, I wrote to Ccru asking them to justify their actions. 
    It was the first time I had attempted to contact them since my healing. They 
    were unable or unwilling to reply. According to the Kowalskys, Ccru were almost 
    certainly Monarch slaves themselves. That was why they could so convincingly 
    feign oblivion about their involvement in the conspiracy, as if they had no 
    knowledge of the way the secret control-codes really operated. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    said before that these are dark days. Indeed they are. It is impossible to 
    overstate the threat that Ccru and Monarch pose. My purpose here tonight is 
    to draw the world&#8217;s attention to that. To open your eyes. Because to 
    confront the Satanic threat, you must accept that it is here. You have to 
    believe the unbelievable.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    speaking as a former Monarch slave myself I would urge caution. To really 
    defeat the Satanists, we must learn everything we can about them. Ccru should 
    be deprogrammed with the same compassionate thoroughness that I was. </font></p>

  <p><em><font color="#dddddd" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Confronted 
    with the fantastic tales of Project Monarch even the most tenuous sanity recoils 
    in revulsion from such patent lunacy, whilst nevertheless remaining ensnarled 
    in sticky threads of credible evidence extracted from the shadowy basements 
    of state intelligence agencies. <P></P>
    Nazi eugenic and mind control experimentation is quite extensively documented. 
    Heinrich Himmler&#8217;s Lebensborn breeding program, concentration camp research, 
    deliberately induced trauma, and obsession with twins is part of the historical 
    record. It is also relatively uncontestable that, as &#8216;Project Monarch&#8217; 
    exposures contend, much of this work was transferred into the hands of American 
    agencies through Project Paperclip. Later CIA mind control experimentation, 
    such as the notorious MK Ultra program, disclosed in documents released by 
    the agency in 1977, exhibits certain continuities with the Nazi research goals. 
    Soviet-based work on mind control, torture and interrogation techniques substantially 
    mirrors the US cold war activities. <P></P>
    Morrison, like O&#8217;Brien before her, draws upon random patches of this 
    legacy to weave a Byzantine tale of world-wide conspiracy, in which she herself 
    takes a starring role. Like all conspiracy fictions, hers is spun out of an 
    all-encompassing narrative that cannot possibly be falsified (because &#8216;they&#8217; 
    want you to believe in their non-existence).<P></P>
    To attempt to refute such narratives is to be drawn into a tedious double 
    game. &#8216;One&#8217; either has to embrace an arbitrary and outrageous 
    cosmic plot (in which everything is being run by the Jews, Masons, Illuminati, 
    CIA, Microsoft, Satan, Ccru&#8230;), or alternatively advocate submission 
    to the most mundane construction of quotidian reality, dismissing the hyperstitional 
    chaos that operates beyond the screens (cosmological &#8216;dark matter&#8217; 
    and &#8216;dark energy&#8217; - virtual, imperceptible, unknown). This is 
    why atheism is usually so boring. <P></P>
    Both conspiracy and common sense - the &#8216;normal reality&#8217; script 
    - depend on the dialectical side of the double game, on reflective twins, 
    belief and disbelief, because disbelief is merely the negative complement 
    of belief: cancellation of the provocation, disintensification, neutralization 
    of stimulus - providing a metabolic yawn-break in the double-game.<P></P>
    Unbelief escapes all this by building a plane of potentiality, upon which 
    the annihilation of judgment converges with real cosmic indeterminacy.<P></P>
    For the demons of unbelief there is no monarch programming except as a side-effect 
    of initiatory Monarch deprogramming (= Monarch Paranoia). <P></P>
    Ccru denies it was ever part of the program. It denies there ever was a program 
    - until the deprogramming process introduced it. <P></P>
    Deprogramming simultaneously retro-produced the program, just as witch-trials 
    preceded devil-worship and regressive hypnotherapy preceded false memory syndrome. 
    Yet, once these &#8216;fictions&#8217; are produced, they function in and 
    as reality. It isn&#8217;t that belief in Project Monarch produces the Monarch 
    Program, but rather that such belief produces equivalent effects to those 
    the reality of Project Monarch would produce, including some that are extremely 
    peculiar and counter-intuitive. <P></P>
    Within the paranoid mode of the double game even twins are turned so as to 
    confirm a persecutory unity - that of the puppet master, the reflection of 
    God, the Monarch. <P></P>
    How absurd to imagine that Lemurian Pandemonium has One purpose or function, 
    or that it could support the throne of a Monarch. From the perspective of 
    Pandemonium gods and their conspiracies emerge all over the place, in countless 
    numbers. &#8220;My name is Legion, for we are many..&#8221;<P></P>
    Unity is only ever a project, a teleological aspiration, never a real presupposition 
    or actual foundation. Monarch paranoia is primordially an allergic panic response 
    to seething, teeming Pandemonic multiplicity. Everywhere it looks it finds 
    the same enemy, the Rorschach-blotted hallucinations of the Evil One masked 
    deliriously in its myriads of deviations, digressions and discrepancies. <P></P>
    In the hands of Justine Morrison, Monarch Paranoia is an overt attempt to 
    overcode Lemurian polyculture through the attribution of unitary purpose (reducing 
    it to the White Atlantean theme). Ccru denounces this endeavor in the strongest 
    possible terms.<P></P>
    We are forced to admit, however, that Morrison&#8217;s comments on Microsoft, 
    Bill Gates, and MSN8 latch on to a number of intriguing phenomena worthy of 
    further intense investigation. <P></P>    Whoever, or whatever, hatched the MSN8 campaign evidently emerged from a zone 
    far beyond the commonly accepted domain of corporate influence and control. 
    For a US$300 million advertising campaign to feature a grotesque insectoid 
    uebermensch, and for it to be widely accused of Satanism, are sufficiently 
    abnormal occurrences to merit serious attention. <P></P>
    Whilst strenuously denying intimate involvement with $Bill or the Microsoft 
    corporation, the Ccru is in a position to confirm the qabbalistic affinity 
    between its own name and the latest MSN product that Morrison alludes to. 
    MSN8 = 81 = CCRU. <P></P>
    Our provisional hypothesis is that the company accidentally summoned something 
    from beyond the spheres with a call sign it does not understand. In this regard, 
    Microsoft personnel are not puppet masters, but only puppets. The same may 
    indeed be true of Justine Morrison - and even of the Ccru - but no Monarch 
    is pulling the strings.  </font></em></p>
