<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd">One 
    or Many Chinas? </font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Much attention 
    has been devoted to the political, diplomatic, economic, and even military 
    aspects of the 'One China' principle. It is natural enough - given the practical 
    gravity of the issues involved - that purely conceptual considerations have 
    not been prioritized. Nevertheless, the 'One China' debate is - at least implicitly 
    - philosophical in nature, since it orbits the abstract and elusive concept 
    of unity. In this respect the experience of Western philosophy, although apparently 
    detached from the intricacies of the 'One China' discussion, has a considerable 
    - and perhaps surprising - relevance to some of its key dilemmas. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Since the 
    dawn of Western philosophy the meaning and status of unity has been a central 
    preoccupation. According to the ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, and 
    to his disciple Plato, the true nature of reality was indivisible and unchanging. 
    In contrast, the multiple and the transient were dismissed and denigrated 
    as mere appearances; deceptions derived from the body and the senses. The 
    tendency of these thinkers was to idealize unity as a supreme and eternal 
    being above and beyond the many, the origin of - and ultimate sovereign over 
    - the world. This intellectual trend was consolidated by the neoplatonic philosopher 
    Plotinus, whose relation to 'The One' crystallized into an uncompromising 
    mystical devotion. When further reinforced by the doctrinal commitments of 
    Judeo-Christian and Islamic monotheism over the course of the following centuries 
    this deification of unity hardened into a fundamental cultural orthodoxy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">An important 
    current in modern European philosophy has called into question the long established 
    privilege of unity. In the final years of the Nineteenth Century Friedrich 
    Nietzsche announced a 'revaluation of all values,' seeking to overthrow the 
    entire tradition descended from Plato and the Church. In the late Twentieth 
    Century this philosophical revolution was re-invigorated by the collaborative 
    work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, which combined arguments from philosophy, 
    mathematics, sociology, and economics to criticize the hierarchical power 
    of 'The One.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">According 
    to Deleuze &amp; Guattari the philosophical conception of unity is not original, 
    but is derived from the organizational model provided by the state. It is 
    no coincidence from this perspective that Plato's most celebrated work (The 
    Republic) is dedicated to the description of an ideal state. When the state 
    unites diverse groups, peoples, interests, and territories, it does so by 
    subordinating them to an over-arching authority. It thus identifies itself 
    with the whole, but also as something additional to - above or beyond - the 
    whole. Its implicit ambition is to both represent and stand above its population. 
    This ambivalence, of a whole that is simultaneously higher than - or superior 
    to - its parts, is intrinsic to the prevailing concept of unity. 'The One' 
    only describes completeness by producing hierarchy and centralization. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Whilst 
    in certain respects philosophically abstract, this conception of unity has 
    obviously played an extremely prominent role in the 'One China' debate. It 
    is particularly well exemplified by the formulation, recently endorsed by 
    Egypt, of &quot;One China with Beijing as its capital,&quot; in which the 
    unity of China is immediately referred to a central political authority. Beijing's 
    own version of the principle, naturally enough, insists that unity be conceived 
    in this way, asserting that &quot;the government of the People's Republic 
    of China is the sole legal government of China.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It is inevitable 
    that such formulations will feed democratic suspicions, since they imply that 
    assimilation into a greater unity presupposes subordination to a non-accountable 
    higher power. The apparent concession involved in the PRC's favored 'One China, 
    two systems' version of the principle does little to assuage such doubts. 
    As the example of Hong Kong demonstrates, the diversity of systems cannot 
    provide a secure basis for popular freedoms when this diversity is itself 
    enveloped under a central authority that completely suppresses the democratic 
    sovereignty of 'its regions.' At best such diversity survives precariously, 
    at worst it serves as a mere mask for oppression. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Given this 
    context it is understandable that ROC negotiators have tended to seek refuge 
    in merely preliminary (and ultimately evasive) formulations, whose model is 
    the 'One China with each side having its own interpretation' position: the 
    '1992 consensus' which is embraced precisely for its lack of definition. A 
    more radical disillusionment with the version of Chinese unity on offer leads 
    to a more-or-less explicit abandonment of the entire One China concept, such 
    as that exemplified by Lee Teng-hui's suggestions: &quot;two Chinas&quot; 
    or &quot;One-China, one Taiwan.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It can 
    thus be seen that mainland bullying - expressed by an adherence to a highly 
    authoritarian version of the 'One China' formula, and associated sabre-rattling 
    - results almost inevitably in an increasingly obfuscatory or even pro-independence 
    response from ROC negotiators. However natural this response might be, its 
    practical consequence - as even the DPP has come to recognize - is the breakdown 
    of cross-straits communication, causing great uncertainty and damage to both 
    sides. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Need any 
    possible 'One China principle' lead to such deadlock? Drawing upon strains 
    of anti-hierarchical thought drawn from both Eastern and Western sources - 
    both Lao-tse and Spinoza are prominent influences - Deleuze &amp; Guattari 
    point to a quite different type of unity to that favored by authoritarian 
    states. They note that systems of relatively 'flat' or non-hierarchized intercommunication 
    provide an alternative model of unity: that of an integrated network. The 
    most important characteristic of any such system is that its unity neither 
    stands above, nor enters into conflict with, the freedom and diversity of 
    its parts. 'A' network, population, or economy is no less One because it is 
    Many: its multiplicity and singularity exactly coincide. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In 'the 
    Age of Networks' the systems that succeed and proliferate are characterized 
    by tightly integrated but decentralized commercial, communicative, and administrative 
    webs. Trends towards economic deregulation, globalization, and the explosive 
    growth of wireless telecommunications and the World Wide Web have produced 
    an environment in which rigidly monolithic institutions, whether governmental 
    or corporate, prove ever more fundamentally dysfunctional. Downsizing, decentralization, 
    and 'bottom-up' dynamics have become the watch-words of postmodern political, 
    economic, and business reform. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Real Chinese 
    unity cannot be conjured by ideological pronouncements - however imaginative 
    or obstinate - but is in fact the product of densely meshed interconnection, 
    interchange, and intercommunication. This process of unification though multiple 
    connections has its own irresistable momentum, as beneath the crust of political 
    stand-off a myriad of small business enterprizes, joint ventures, and individual 
    initiatives promote trade, travel, and cultural exchanges. It is in this way 
    that a non-oppressive cohesion - or integration without subordination - builds 
    its own model: producing the future of a free and diverse One China from the 
    bottom-up. <br>
