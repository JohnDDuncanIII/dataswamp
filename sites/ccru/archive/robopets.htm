<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#dddddd">Robot's 
    aren't what they used to be</font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" -->
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Even now, 
    at the very beginning of the new millennium, it is clear that the age of robots 
    is already dawning. Science fiction writers have long anticipated this development, 
    but the way in which it is occurring is stranger than even they imagined. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The word 
    robot - Czech for 'forced laborer' - was first used as the name for a 'mechanical 
    man' in Karel Capek's 1920 play RUR. Capek envisaged his robots as automated 
    slaves designed to replace human workers, an idea that has maintained a tenacious 
    grip on the twentieth century mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">As far 
    as the age of robots is concerned the world has been divided into optimists, 
    who look forward to the relief of industrial and domestic drudgery, and pessimists, 
    who expect unemployment, social dislocation, and even extermination. Capek 
    himself belonged to the pessimist camp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Whatever 
    their differences, both sides in this debate have been united in the assumption 
    that robots were basically a serious matter, and that - as their name implies 
    - their destiny would be to work. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">What might 
    now be described as the 'traditional' robot industry largely conforms to this 
    vision. The usage of robot workers was pioneered by the automobile industry, 
    and later adopted by consumer electronics, biotechnology, and robotics manufacturing, 
    especially in Japan which currently possesses more than 50 percent of the 
    world's 750 000 industrial robots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Whilst 
    the robotic automation of production continues to revolutionize manufacturing 
    processes around the world, what it is unable to do - by its very nature - 
    is generate a mass robot market. The true dawning of the robot age requires 
    a migration from the capital-goods to the consumer sector; not merely production 
    by - but also mass production of - robots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In order 
    to become items of mass-consumption robots have had to undergo a rapid and 
    astonishing transformation, from mechanical slave laborers to ludicrous toys 
    and pets. By the turn of the millennium it was already obvious that alongside 
    the serious world of industrial, military, medical, and space-faring robots 
    an explosion of new and frivolous robot-species was taking place. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The most 
    important direct precursor to the new wave of robot pets was not a robot at 
    all. In 1996 Bandai Corp. released its Tamagotchi or &quot;cute little egg,&quot; 
    an &quot;original virtual pet&quot; consisting of a microchip-supported digital 
    cartoon chicken, accessed through a small LCD. Priced at about US$16, Tamagotchi 
    immediately became a major craze and racked-up spectacular sales, shipping 
    over 70 million units in 1996 alone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The crucial 
    innovation underlying the Tamagotchi phenomenon was that it required constant 
    attention from its owner, who had to feed, entertain, scold, medicate, and 
    clean up after it in order to keep it alive. Tamagotchi rearing became a major 
    social preoccupation, disrupting the activity of schools and even businesses. 
    The Bandai instruction manual contained the following ominous warning: &quot;If 
    you keep your Tamagotchi full and happy, it will grow into a cute, happy cyber 
    creature. If you neglect Tamagotchi, it will grow into an unattractive alien.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Perhaps 
    the most decisive role in the creation of a mass-market consumer robot industry 
    was played by the toy giant Hasbro (maker of Trivial Pursuit and Mr. Potato 
    Head).</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In 
    1997, seeking to cash-in on the Tamagotchi craze, Hasbro introduced their 
    own Giga-Pets line, competitively priced at US$10, and becoming the top selling 
    toy of the year. This proved to be only the beginning of an astonishing run 
    for Hasbro. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In 1998 
    the company bought Tiger Electronics, and began embodying digital pets in 
    robot toys. The pioneering device was Furby, &quot;a cuddly stand-alone animatronic 
    pet,&quot; launched in October 1998, priced in the US$30 range. Furby set 
    the standard for a new breed of mass-market robots, or &quot;interactive toys.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Like a 
    Tamagotchi or Giga-Pet, Furby required attention and &quot;rearing,&quot; 
    although its sensitivity, behavior, and personality development was far more 
    complicated. Furby displayed a combination of emotions, and learnt to speak 
    and sing in its own language - Furbish - and also in English. To appeal to 
    boys it was equipped with a fart-reflex. Furby could interact with other Furby's, 
    using an infrared channel to exchange behaviors. It was also programmed to 
    be unpredictable. As Scott Kirsner remarked in an article in Wired magazine: 
    &quot;If one Furby was angry, another Furby in the same room might start singing 
    to soothe it.&quot; Furby was the best selling toy of 1998. Tiger also took 
    the top spot the following year with Furby Babies, and astoundingly repeated 
    the achievement yet again in 2000, although this time in response to innovations 
    at Sony. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In 1999 
    the sophistication of robot pets underwent a quantum leap under the influence 
    of Sony's Digital Creations Laboratory and it's 'robot dog' Aibo (whose name 
    means 'companion' in Japanese, as well as being an acronym for Artificial 
    Intelligence roBOt). Aibo married the already standard features of robot pets 
    -- movement, communication, emotion, and maturation -- with state-of-the-art 
    robotics. Aibo's elaborate range of instinctive and learnt behaviors enabled 
    it to explore, adapt, bond with its owner and respond to training.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In June 
    1999 a limited edition of 5,000 first generation Aibos were put on the market, 
    priced at US$2500 each. Japan's quota of 3,000 was completely sold out in 
    20 minutes! The 2,000 allotted to the U.S. had all been sold in four days. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In November 
    2000 135,000 orders were received for the production run of 10,000 second 
    generation Aibos. Sony has since sold at least 45,000 Aibos, which remains 
    by far the most advanced robot pet on the market. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">It was 
    not long before Hasbro's Tiger Electronics released its own robot dog, Poo-Chi. 
    Selling at around US$30, Poo-Chi has a moving head, ears, legs and mouth, 
    it barks, speaks, and sings six different songs, stands, sits, and dances 
    on tiptoes, senses light, sounds, and touch, and its animated eyes convey 
    the emotions of happiness, sadness, and love. Its &quot;advanced bio-rhythmic 
    technology&quot; allows it to interact with other Poo-Chi puppies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">In the 
    year of its release over 10 million Poo-Chi units were sold in 65 countries 
    worldwide, including 1.5 million over the Christmas season in the U.S. alone. 
    Poo-Chi was the No.1 selling toy for the year 2000. <br>
    In the wake of Poo-Chi's phenomenal success, Tiger's line of Robo-Chi Pets 
    was expanded to include Super Poo-Chi; Meow-Chi the interactive cat; Chirpy-Chi 
    a talkative bird; Petal-Chi a dancing flower; two Dino-Chi toys (T-Rex and 
    Pterodactyl); and perhaps most bizarre of all Shelby, &quot;an adorable, talkative 
    interactive clam&quot; with animated eyes, antennas, and mouth, whose 180-word 
    vocabulary mixes English, Furbish and its own special language, Shelbish. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">As robots 
    migrate from the factory into the home, from the capital-goods sector into 
    the mass-consumer market, they are undergoing an unanticipated change in nature. 
    No one - not even the most imaginative science-fiction writer - ever predicted 
    that the first wave of mass-produced robots would include a talking clam! 
    More importantly, few if any can have expected that the first social niche 
    to be subject to large-scale robot colonization would be that of pets. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The ruthlessly 
    functional soulless slave-laborers of twentieth century robot fantasies were 
    intended as replacements for humans. The basic flaws in this gloomy and totalitarian 
    vision are clearly exposed by the exploding population of robot dogs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">The Economist 
    magazine quotes Sony's Toshi Doi introducing Aibo with the words: &quot;This 
    machine is completely useless.&quot; He predicts that the demand for these 
    &quot;useless&quot; entertainment robots will exceed the PC market in ten-to-thirty 
    years time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Unlike 
    manufacturers, consumers value autonomy and personality in their robots. If 
    robots are to share our lives we expect them to function as companions with 
    social capabilities: communication, emotion, and interactivity. It seems that 
    we want them to need us. We even demand that they respond badly to neglect.
