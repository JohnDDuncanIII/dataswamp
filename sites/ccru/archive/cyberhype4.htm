  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd"><i>Have 
    you not heard of the wanderers of Yueh</i> - Hsu Wu Key (Ancient Taoist Mystic)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Beijing 
    has won the 2008 Olympics. This victory is widely viewed as vindication of 
    a model of economic development that is centred on the strength of an authoritarian 
    state.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Ccru is 
    watching for what is brewing at the margins - since this is where everything 
    interesting occurs. It is the forces seeping in from the periphery - not the 
    dictates of the Politburo - that is ultimately responsible for the development 
    of the mainland. China calls itself the Middle Kingdom but it still has edges 
    and increasingly the edges are taking over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Nowhere 
    is this clearer than in Shenzen, a small town on the Pearl River Delta. In 
    1979 - when it achieved the freedom granted to the Special Economic Zones 
    - Shenzen was nothing but farmland. Twenty-two years later its streets are 
    filled with skyscrapers and frenzied shoppers, the product of an economy growing 
    at a staggering 34% a year. The key to this success lies precisely in its 
    distance from the centre. In Shenzen there is a saying: &quot;the mountains 
    are high and the emperor is far away.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">It is 
    no surprise that economic activity flourishes on the margins. State centred 
    Confucian society was traditionally hostile to traders. As early as the late 
    Chou dynasty (1100 -770 BCE) undesirables were banished to the areas south 
    of the Yangtze River. Merchants were exiled to the edges of the world, populated 
    by pirates and Taoist sorcerers. In Chinese hyperstitional lore these edges 
    are known as the lands of Yueh.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">This zone 
    -on the southern coastal edge of the mainland- bred a maritime culture of 
    commercial dynamism and entrepreneurial risk that was sharply distinct from 
    the inward-looking, land-locked, state power of the North. Yueh spawned a 
    hybrid population with an offshore mentality, inspired less by the rigidity 
    of Confucianism than by &quot;the underground anti-authoritarian counter-cultures 
    of Taoist and Zen Buddhist heterodoxies, that long have flourished on the 
    Chinese periphery.&quot; It is this hybrid, dynamic, peripheral culture - 
    rather than the state - that is the engine of economic growth in the Chinese 
    world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">For thousands 
    of years Yueh culture spread outside its borders. Coastal trade brought it 
    to Siberia, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, through the Indian Ocean, the Malay Peninsula, 
    and across to the Indian subcontinent. This overseas movement dramatically 
    accelerated when, in 1276, the Mongols invaded and previously sedentary populations 
    swarmed down from the North. Forced outward by the influence of the nomads 
    the people of Yueh dispersed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Today 
    there are approximately 60 million Chinese living outside the mainland. This 
    makes the Chinese diaspora the second largest in the world. By far the majority 
    of these originate from the southern coastal provinces, regions which were 
    once the ancient Kingdom of Yueh. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">This diasporic 
    population has an intense economic vibrancy. This is produced through a distinct 
    market culture unlike that of the colonists, merchants and multinationals 
    from Europe, America and even Japan. Chinese business operates in an exterior 
    relation to state backed capitalism with its lumbering bureaucracies, centralized 
    decision making processes and national headquarters. It functions instead 
    through a true transnationalism, planet-wide networks of communication and 
    connections (guanxi), and a proliferation of small and medium sized businesses 
    familiar with insecurity and limber enough to manoeuvre in unfamiliar environments.<br>
    <br>
    Recently this diasporic community has reconnected with its home on the mainland's 
    southern periphery. This link - between a marginal land and its people - has 
    introduced a decentred, outward-looking mode of development based on foreign 
    investment and export oriented growth. The fate of China is being transformed 
    not by the authoritarian control of the central committee, but by this 'opening 
    up, which is being engineered from the periphery. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#dddddd">Beijing 
    has seven years to prepare to welcome the world inside its borders, but the 
    outside has already invaded. The exiled wanderers of Yueh have returned. <br>
