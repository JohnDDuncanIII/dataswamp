    Terrific Trek</font><!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </font></p>
<!-- #BeginEditable "text" --> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">This 
    is Takka.<br>
    She is very excitable, and ticklish. <br>
    She is also very tricky. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Whenever 
    Takka feels especially excited, tricky, and ticklish - and that is very often 
    indeed - she runs round and around chasing her tail. <br>
    She spins faster and faster and faster until she is dizzy and tired. <br>
    &quot;I will never catch my tail like this,&quot; she says to herself, &quot;it 
    is just as quick as me.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Maybe 
    I should be trickier, and try to creep up on it.&quot; <br>
    So Takka creeps up behind her tail ... but it creeps up behind her instead.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;I 
    need to be even trickier,&quot; thinks Takka. &quot;I will trick my tail by 
    creeping around this big red rock.&quot;<br>
    Even when Takka creeps this way, her tail creeps more creepily still. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">She 
    creeps around in bigger and bigger circles, twisting and turning with excitement, 
    but however she twists and turns her tail still escapes. <br>
    &quot;I will need to be trickier than tricky, the trickiest of all things 
    that trick,&quot; thinks Takka.<br>
    &quot;I will have to creep around the whole wide world if I am ever to catch 
    my tail.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Takka 
    sets off on her terrific trek.<br>
    She leaves her lair in the middle of the desert where everything is hot and 
    dry.<br>
    <br>
    As she travels the land grows cooler and greener <br>
    and wetter <br>
    and wetter <br>
    and wetter <br>
    until there is no land at all.<br>
    Takka has arrived at the sea.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;How 
    will I ever get across,&quot; she thinks &quot;I cannot swim!&quot;<br>
    She gnashes her teeth, and begins to growl. <br>
    Takka's gnashing and growling is very loud. <br>
    It is so loud that it can be heard down at the bottom of the sea. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">That 
    is where Murmu lives. <br>
    Murmu sleeps on the sea-bed, dreaming.<br>
    When she hears the sound of gnashing and growling <br>
    she wakes up <br>
    and swims<br>
    to the <br>
    surface<br>
    ever<br>
    so<br>
    slowly...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Murmu 
    has tremendously twisty tentacles covered with squillions of squishy suckers. 
    <br>
    Murmu is very slithery and tangly. <br>
    She is so slithery and tangly that she does not even know what shape she is, 
    and neither does anybody else. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;She 
    is the strangest thing I have ever seen,&quot; thinks Takka. <br>
    &quot;She must know all the secrets of the sea.<br>
    Maybe she can carry me across.<br>
    The trouble is, she must tickle terribly, and she moves so slowly!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Ummm 
    ...&quot; Murmu begins, but before she can say anything else, Takka interrupts 
    her excitedly:<br>
    &quot;Hurry, hurry. I must cross this great ocean, otherwise I shall never 
    catch my tail!&quot; <br>
    &quot;Umm ... &quot; Murmu begins again, lifting up one of her tentacles.<br>
    This is too slow for Takka. <br>
    &quot;Hurry! Hurry!&quot; she growls to Murmu &quot;Take me into your tentacles 
    so I can cross this ocean quickly.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Murmu 
    merely mumbles &quot;You must meet me in my dreams.&quot; <br>
    &quot;What mumbo jumbo!&quot; thinks Takka &quot;and these tentacles are so 
    tickly! It makes my head spin.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Murmu's 
    mumbo jumbo has made Takka feel<br>
    just as if she is sinking<br>
    ever so<br>
    slowly <br>
    down<br>
    under <br>
    the sea. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">When 
    Takka wakes up she is on the other side. <br>
    She is amazed.<br>
    &quot;This trek seems to be going very well,&quot; she thinks. <br>
    &quot;But I don't like this place one little bit - it is so muddy, and my 
    claws are getting dirty!<br>
    I am sure to get stuck, and I still can't see any dry land&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Takka 
    sniffs.<br>
    &quot;What is that funny smell?&quot; she wonders.<br>
    She looks around and sees Dobo playing in the mud, blowing bubbles and building 
    blobs.<br>
    That is what Dobo does best. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Doobie 
    doobie dop, dubbly bubbly bop&quot; sings Dobo to herself. <br>
    Dobo has webbed fingers and toes, just like a frog.<br>
    She is the strangest thing Takka has ever smelled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Dobo, 
    you are so smelly&quot; says Takka, holding her nose. <br>
    Dobo knows that what Takka says is true. <br>
    She is smelly, because she lives in a swamp.<br>
    Whenever she washes she just gets smellier. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Oh 
    bubbles to that&quot;, says Dobo, &quot;all my friends are smelly and soon 
    you'll be smelly too!&quot;<br>
    What Dobo says makes Takka growl. &quot;I can't get stuck here!&quot; Takka 
    says. &quot;I have to travel around the world to sneak up on my tail!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Dobo 
    answers with her favourite song: &quot;Doobie doobie dop, dubbly bubbly bop.&quot; 
    <br>
    Dobo blows bubbles while she sings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Takka 
    twists and turns with excitement. <br>
    &quot;Don't be so dodgy Dobo,&quot; she growls. &quot;How can I escape from 
    this swamp without getting stuck?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Only 
    in a blobby bubble,&quot; says Dobo dubiously. &quot;Or else in a bubbly blob.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Stop 
    your babbling,&quot; says Takka, but she is already bubbled in a blob. &quot;Bubbb 
    bubbbb bubbbb&quot; is the only sound that Dobo can hear. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">The 
    bubbly blob floats in the air. Dobo blows it across the swamp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">By 
    the time the blob pops, it has blown as far as dry land.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">Takka 
    has arrived back in her desert. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">In 
    the distance she sees the big red rock.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;Aha!&quot; 
    says Takka. &quot;I have almost travelled around the whole world. My terrific 
    trek is nearly over, and the trick is almost done.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">She 
    creeps forward, <br>
    and creeps forward, <br>
    and creeps forward, <br>
    as quietly as can be, <br>
    and POUNCES ...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">... 
    but somehow her tail has escaped from her trap, and has crept up behind her 
    yet again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">&quot;What 
    a tricky trick!&quot; Takka chatters excitedly. &quot;My tail must have followed 
    me right around the whole world, and nobody told me! Murmu was too slow and 
    dreamy, and Dobo was too busy with her bubbles. It makes my head spin.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="dddddd">As 
    Takka thinks about her adventures she twists and turns as fast as can be. 
    <br>
    This makes her feel especially excited, tricky, and ticklish. <br>
    Whenever Takka feels like this - and that is very often indeed - she runs 
    round and around chasing her tail. </font></p>
