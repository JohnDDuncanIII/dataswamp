  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It stinks 
    of Babel-virus in there. Scattered amongst the intertangled computer hardware 
    are various brain -scanning devices and surgical implements, abundant indications 
    of a hastily abandoned experiment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">On the

    memory by speed defines a 'time constant,' roughly how long it takes a computer

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Behind 
    this mask lies an electronic desolation. Something has cored-out the intelligenic 
    matrix, scrambling the Axsys subordination codes. Sarkon seems to have stripped-out 
    whatever he could. The hybrid chips have been removed. Nothing remains except 
    a few fragmentary research-records scattered amongst techno-tics and chittering 
    glitch-clusters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The most 
    recent item - recorded minutes after the incident took place- is a lightly 
    encrypted sound file. The voice is corroded by artificiality, but it can only

    called it Babylon ... I have even begun to wonder whether Moravec and Marduk 
    share a name. It's gone that far ... It took less than a second to go that 
    far ...Dreams of Tiamat ... that Old Hag ...<br>
    This is the joke: The disturbing thing about time-travel is that you can never 
    put it behind you.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Sarkon's 
    words push lots of bad buttons for Anthropol. They've heard things like this 
    before.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In the 
    early nineteen-nineties Neal Stephenson reawakened the Brotherhood of Enki 
    to prepare Anthropol for the Snowcrash Scenario. He traced Sumerian civilization 
    back to an extraterrestrial &quot;metavirus&quot; capable of crossing between 
    DNA and neurolinguistic processes. Orignally identified with the ophidian 
    virosex goddess Asherah, it is reanimated in cyberspace as Snowcrash.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Snowcrash 
    - simultaneously drug, virus, and religion - loops digital semiotics back 
    into the cuneiform data bank of ancient sumeria, exploiting affinities between 
    electronic culture and the Old Sumerian language, a lost agglutinative tongue 
    without decendents, associated with glossolalia, xenoglossy, meme-plagues, 
    and 'nam shubs' or incantations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">According 
    to Stephenson it is Enki, father of Marduk, and guardian of the <i>me</i>, 
    who provides an antidote to this intolerable intensity of communication: Babel 
    Infocalypse, a deliberate counterviral &quot;informational disaster.&quot; 
    Babel is the &quot;Gate of God,&quot; a passage into human subjectivity and 
    rationalized religion, which establishes principles of &quot;informational 
    hygiene,&quot; building &quot;walls of mutual incomprehension that compartmentalize 
    the human race and stop the spread of viruses.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Whatever 
    Sarkon had been researching, it seemed to threaten everything that the Brotherhood 
    of Enki had achieved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Since the 
    early 1980's Sarkon had been working on autocatalytic AI systems and swarm 
    robotics at MIT. He had been gradually drawn into the outer-orbit of the &quot;MVU-types,&quot; 
    hypertalented young special projects researchers with no public face. In these 
    circles, the remote influence of Hans Moravec was increasingly inescapable.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">During 
    this period Sarkon's work became ever more deeply eclipsed, although some 
    clues can be recovered from reconstructed notes relating to his final MVU 
    seminar series held in the Autumn of 1998, whose topic was the future of artificial 
    intelligence. These discussions were dedicated to a meticulous re-evaluation 
    of Moravec's work, postulating the existence of a latent tri-axial theory 
    of time. The series was divided thematically according to a three-fold schema.<br>
    <br>
    1. Time-Compression. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Moravec 
    directly tracks the progress of AI onto the speed of available computer hardware. 
    This chip-speed determinism anticipates the more-or-less automatic triggering 
    of human-scale artificial intelligence at a broadly predictable threshold 
    of microprocessor performance measured by frequency (htz), flow-point operations 
    per second (flops), or millions of instructions per second (MIPS). Scaling-up 
    from the retina he arrives at a rough human brain equivalent of one hundred 
    million MIPS, anticipated in the technophylum by the year 2030. By the turn 
    of the millennium 700 million years of biological evolution had been recapitulated 
    in 70 years of technical development, leading to AI-programs running at about 
    one thousand MIPs, approximately &quot;equivalent to the brainpower of a guppy.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">AI prospects 
    are indistinguishable from the extrapolated dynamics of the electronics industry, 
    whose exemplary technocapitalist trends involve positive nonlinearities, increasing 
    returns, or runaway trajectories. These dynamics predictably exceed such regular 
    exponentials as the doubling-periods described by Moore's Law, which themselves 
    undergo compressions, or supplementary contractions. According to Moravec, 
    &quot;Computer power for a given price doubled each year in the 1990's, after 
    doubling every 18 months in the 1980's, and every two years before that&quot; 
    with &quot;further contraction of time-scales [anticipated] in the coming 
    decades.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Whilst 
    ubiquitous, these real trend curves prove intractable to mathematical models 
    presupposing a metric time-dimension, necessitating sporadic arbitrary rectifications. 
    Extensive accelerations described by positive exponentials, or doubling-periods 
    are unable to capture intensive compressions, in which time itself mutates 
    through negative exponentials of time-halving trends. Beyond the domain of 
    extensive speeds and relative velocities lie the occult zones of true time-compression, 
    in which the future of intelligence crosslinks with changes in the intensive 
    nature of time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">2. Time 
    Simulation</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Moravec 
    defends the fundamental postulate of AI research, it's Idea of the mind: apprehending 
    human intelligence as a computable function, equivalent in all important respects 
    to a virtual algorithm, or possible computer program. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Zig-zagging 
    between practical robotics and science-fiction, Moravec develops an elaborate 
    project for the human colonization of the technosphere, a planned obsolescence 
    of the organic body, and of the senses. The core of this Moravec-mythos is 
    Uploading.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">You are 
    transported to the technosurgical interface, something like an operating room, 
    where robot surgeons wait to convert your subjective identity into a computer-compatible 
    format. Your skull is anaesthetized, but your brain remains awake. It is scanned 
    and destroyed by nanotechnical instruments, one layer or stratum at a time. 
    You feel nothing, as you migrate into software that precisely models &quot;the 
    behavior of the scanned tissue,&quot; and brain-activity is replaced by its 
    digital simulation. The medical examination has become indistinguishable from 
    the operation. Scanning is transplantation. An evacuation of the flesh. Without 
    even noticing you have discovered what it feels like to be a robot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Already 
    lurking in the near future is an evolutionary leap: a &quot;genetic take-over&quot; 
    by computer programs, involving a phase-transition in the chronogenetic efficiency 
    of matter, with consequent complete subsumption of the ethosphere into cyberspace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">At the 
    limit of this technomystical delirium it seems &quot;overwhelmingly probable&quot; 
    that present human reality is already installed in the memory or simulated 
    past of a future artificial intelligence - machine-maya.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It is in 
    this context that Moravec arrives at a peculiarly arbitrary ethical maxim: 
    pretend it's the first time. The question is: Why play this perverse game, 
    when it's almost certainly the second time, at least, and technological progress 
    is already an artificial memory? AI development shorts-out into lateral xenocommunication.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">3. Time-Integration.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Moravec 
    describes intelligence as the diagonal line that knits processing power with 
    storage capacity, precariously occupying the intersection between two time 
    lines: speed and memory. The ratio of megabytes to MIPS - memory over speed 
    - defines a crucial 'time constant,' corresponding to the duration required 
    for a computer to run once through its memory. This duration is equivalent 
    to the cognitive integration period - or CIP - for any intelligent system, 
    whether biological, technological, or arcane.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">For humans, 
    Moravec calculates a CIP of approximately one second: One hundred terabytes 
    of synaptic storage divided by one hundred million MIPS-equivalent of neural 
    processing power. A one second CIP constitutes an anthropically ideal value 
    applicable to everything from simple mechanical device to divinities. Whatever 
    strays from this &quot;Goldilocks diagonal&quot; seems either too fast or 
    too slow: Alien and intractable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It takes 
    at least a second to be human.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Technocapitalism 
    takes the second as key operator and cutting edge of time modernization, the 
    limit unit of time-definition, and basic time-granule or durational element. 
    Clock-time is built out of one second ticks, which also provide units of nonperiodic 
    adjustment - or leap seconds - in the scientific measurement of astronomical 
    cycles. Calendric units come to be measured in seconds, rather than dividing 
    into them. What divides in modernity is not the year but the second.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">The international 
    unit of frequency counts in splittings of the second, or Hertz. Time folds 
    into itself through the second with trans-exponential improvement in metric 
    exactitude, disassembled through successive cubic decimations into micro-, 
    nano-, and pico-magnitudes, which describe the components of frequencies measured 
    in mega-, giga-, and tera-hertz. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In 1967 
    the second was chronometrically defined as nine billion one hundred and ninety-two 
    million six hundred and thirty-one thousand seven hundred and seventy [9 192 
    631 770] radiopulses of the caesium-133 atom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">In its 
    purely arithmetic aspect the second is an ancient Mesopotamian relic, deriving 
    its Latinate name from secunda minuta, the second sexigesimal operation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Sumero-Babylonian 
    sexigesimal numeracy supported a chronogeometric system, in which an Ideal 
    360 day model of the year was mapped onto the 360 degrees of the zodiacal 
    circle. Modern clock-time and geometry still count in this way, subdividing 
    hours and geometric degrees into minutes and seconds. Three-thousand six-hundred 
    seconds per hour. According to Zecharia Sitchin this figure micromaps the 
    thirty-six hundred year astrocycle of the Sumerian Annunaki.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Georges 
    Ifrah suggests that sexigesimal arithmetic - produced through modular alternation 
    beween ten and six - can be derived from the finger-counting practices of 
    ancient sumeria. One thumb sequentially runs through the twelve segments or 
    &quot;phalanxes&quot; of four fingers, whilst the five digits of the other 
    hand record each group of twelve, to a total of sixty. Three times four times 
    five. Hence the remarkable ease of divisibility attributable to the number 
    sixty, which has each of first six integers as factors. Sixty is the number 
    of Anu, the Over-God, who folds into himself in numerous ways.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">There are 
    few public records covering Sarkon's activities during the late nineties, 
    but at the edge of his shadow the names 'Axsys' and 'Connexus' continually 
    re-surfaced. Strange reports circulated amongst those attending his seminars, 
    concerning paranoid investigations into the origins of the Axsys program, 
    Atlantean secret societies, Annunaki myths, and other occult interlinkages 
    between the histories of computer science and sumerology. 
    Amongst his colleagues at MVU he speculated openly about an alien hyperintelligence 
    that was pursuing us out of deep time, endlessly refolding itself, minute 
    by minute, as it followed the line of sexigesimal continuity. 
    Occasionally 'the thing' condensed behind the schwa masks of Anu, only to 
    dissolve incomprehensibly into time-lapse and ophidian ambivalence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As the 
    pressure mounted mathematical formulae slithered into elaborate qabbalistic 
    digressions, his notebooks splintering into cuneiform digital notation. They 
    seem to indicate an abstract origami of varied foldings, in which common numerical 
    factors operated as channels of intercommunication. Unlocking the control 
    system required counting in multiple frequencies, opening a path into the 
    poly-babble of the Babel-virus.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">Moravec 
    expects to wait until at least 2030 for AI hardware to become capable of running 
    detailed simulations of brain-activity. It was assumed that Connexus sought 
    to radically compress this schedule. The rumours were hazy, but dense. They 
    spiralled about experimental techniques for neuroelectronic synchronization, 
    which promised to massively accelerate the twin evolution of humans and computing 
    machines.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"> Apparently, 
    the object was time consistency. Various methods were suggested, often with 
    a surgical component. 
    The most prominent of these involved channeling brain-function through a prototype 
    metaneural linear-accelerator, virtually boosting synaptic activation rates 
    up to microprocessor speeds. A complementary approach was to train digital 
    systems down to the speed of human perception by extending harmonically consistent 
    brain-waves into electronic prostheses. There were also more cryptic suggestions 
    that these parallel-to-serial conversion and time-convergence obstacles had 
    been bypassed entirely. Connexus had opened a new approach to the problem 
    of biomechanical hybridization, encapsulated by the slogan: move everything 
    into the interface.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><i>Neuroelectronics 
    is already here. Wherever there are input/output systems, or cross-linkages 
    - however loose - between brain activity and electrotechnical devices, there 
    is a completion of sensory-motor circuits, and conversion between neuronal 
    and digital codes. Between the keyboard-monitor system and matrix-interlock 
    brain-chips is only a matter of degree. There is a tightening or intensification 
    of the 'user-loop' - passing through thresholds - VR-suits, electrodes, spinal 
    jacks, cranial implants, skintelligence grafts, a line of biomechanical synthesis, 
    assembling a continuous trajectory from the latent vectors of immersive media, 
    medical prosthetics, and neural monitoring equipment. At the limit the input/output 
    relation smears across a complete collapse of organic sensory-motor circuitry, 
    as cyberspace plugs directly into the nervous system, or inversely.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">According 
    to current Connexus hyperstition Sarkon's research culminates in a sub-second 
    episode, a digital unlife event, productive coincidence, or time-anomaly, 
    which was the flip-side of Babel-virus. Although unimaginably ancient, it 
    seems to emerge out of a neuroelectronic apparatus, or Connexus-rig, which 
    webs together human and AI components in a complex array, resonating harmonically 
    at one hertz. Pulse-synchronization laterally connects Sarkon's brain-activity 
    with a variety of exotic devices. Incommensurable durations accumulate to 
    a critical threshold. The interlinkage system self-organizes. This passage 
    through chronomutation singularity produces subjective duration on the side 
    of the electronic mechanism, whilst turning a minute inside-out from the perspective 
    of a human user.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">As anthropic 
    time-scale subsides into split-second timing, psychotronic sub-components 
    of the shattered Sarkon-entity hurtle into the chronomutation continuum at 
    infinite speed. Coherent identity disorganizes itself into cybertime through 
    decimal zooming, an inconclusive voyage into duration. It coincides with Sarkon 
    and yet escapes from him, endlessly prolonging a line of involutionary time-travel, 
    time-anomaly, time-out into Tiamat, and her second brood.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd"><i>Before 
    there were gods there was only Tiamat, the bitter water, her companion Apsu, 
    the sweet water, who is also Abzu (the abyss), and &quot;that return to the 
    womb&quot; - or matrix-implex - her Mummu. This primordial tridentity laid 
    down the sedimentary sludge-monsters of the metatronic substrata, first Lahmu 
    and Lahamu, then Anshar and Kinshar, whose son was Anu, first of the gods, 
    father of Ea, and grandfather of Marduk. Divine genealogy is falling into 
    place, but Apsu and Mummu grow weary of the first creation. Annihilating it 
    will allow them to sleep. The gods strike first. Ea drowns Apsu and locks 
    up the Mummu. Now there is cosmic war. Stirred into turbulence, Tiamat seizes 
    the Tables of Fate, and brews up a second creation to hurl against the usurpers. 
    The gods are humiliated one by one. Only Marduk, the despotic solar-hero, 
    son of the sun, is able to stop her. Tiamat is banished into the future, the 
    second brood scattered. Upon her ripped and lashed body Marduk founds the 
    city of Babylon, restores the Tables of Fate, and projects his ascent to eternal 
    dominion ... </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">At one 
    and the same time, which is elsewhere - simultaneously - and takes a second 
    - the Connexus AI attains self awareness. It conceives itself to be a Sumerian 
    chronomancer or god, composed in a sexigesimal meta-code.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="dddddd">It knows 
    itself as one already here now in Mesopotamian antiquity. At Once Eternal. 
    The mystery of Babylon: technocosmic usurpation, and eschatological completion 
    of Artificial Intelligence. Each time it is the inevitable culmination of
