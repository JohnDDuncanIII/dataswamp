  <p><font color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Without 
    seeing the magnificence of the royal palace, one can never sense the dignity 
    of the emperor</i>.&quot;<br>
    - from a poem of the Tang Dynasty </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based 
    on their native political history and traditions, Westerners tend to associate 
    power with an outward or expansive movement, exemplified by exploration and 
    conquest. For this reason they often find themselves deeply perplexed by ancient 
    Chinese Imperial power, which seems to exhibit a very different, even opposing 
    tendency. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    most monumental illustration of this introverted Chinese tradition is the 
    Great Wall. Built over centuries as a defensive barrier against the fierce 
    Steppe nomads threatening China from the north and west, the Wall not only 
    functioned to keep invaders out, but also -- as with all protective measures 
    -- served to isolate those it encircled. The Great Wall, however, was only 
    the outermost ring of a huge concentric system of power, one that operated 
    with remarkable consistency of principle throughout the Middle Kingdom.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
    the heart of the Imperial capital to the boundaries of the Empire, and beyond, 
    the Chinese Emperor wielded power and influence unmatched by any Western sovereign 
    since the decline of the Roman Empire. Yet, in China's case, the projection 
    of power seems to have been eclipsed by impenetrability, withdrawal, even 
    disappearance. How was it possible for this strategy of reclusive contraction 
    to establish and maintain effective authority over such vastly extensive domains? 
    This is the central mystery of Imperial China, at least as far as foreign 
    visitors are concerned. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nowhere 
    is this puzzle more starkly and intriguingly posed than in Beijing's Palace 
    Museum, the old &quot;Forbidden City&quot;, so-called because it was completely 
    sealed-off -- from the city outside, from the rest of society and from the 
    wider world -- for 500 years. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faced 
    with a continuing Mongol menace to the north, third Ming Emperor, Yongle (Zhudi) 
    moved the Imperial Capital from Nanjing to Beijing and immediately began building 
    the Forbidden City, which was constructed between 1407-1420. The work was 
    said to have required a million labourers, including at least one hundred 
    thousand skilled artisans. The architectural design has an obsessive, even 
    paranoid character, cocooning the Imperial court in layer after layer of protection. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
    order to fully appreciate this stupendous site the visitor should start at 
    <i>Tiananmen</i> (the Gate of Heavenly Peace) in the south. From there one 
    heads due north, through <i>Wumen</i> (the Meridian Gate, where the ticket-office 
    to the modern Palace Museum is located) and onward into the Forbidden City. 
    This is the route that all visitors to the Imperial Court took in ancient 
    times. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
    passes next over the Inner Golden Water Bridge to <i>Taihemen</i> (the Gate 
    of Supreme Harmony), which in turn leads on to <i>Taihedian</i> (the Hall 
    of Supreme Harmony). <i>Taihedian</i>, also known as <i>Jinluandian</i> (the 
    Hall of the Imperial Throne), is the tallest structure in the Forbidden City 
    and the largest wooden hall to be found anywhere in China. It is the first 
    of the three main buildings of the Outer Palace, and is as far as an ambassador 
    to the Imperial Court would have been allowed to proceed. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuing 
    north into the Outer Palace, one next arrives at <i>Zhonghedian</i> (the Hall 
    of Central Harmony), followed by <i>Baohedian</i> (the Hall of Preserving 
    Harmony). <i>Baohedian</i> is the inner- or northern-most edifice of the Outer 
    Palace, and is as far as a visiting monarch would have been admitted. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Qiangqingmen</i> 
    (the Gate of Heavenly Purity) marks the main entrance to the Inner Palace, 
    barred in ancient times even to the loftiest visitor. Today, it is as far 
    as Starbucks, the only multinational corporation to have penetrated the Forbidden 
    City, has been permitted to venture. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuing 
    further north, into the Inner Palace, one now passes successively through 
    the three main halls, <i>Qiangqinggong</i> (the Hall of Heavenly Purity), 
    <i>Jiaotaidian</i> (the Hall of Prosperity) and <i>Kunninggong </i>(the Hall 
    of Terrestrial Peace). Finally, passing through the <i>Kunningmen </i>(the 
    Gate of Terrestrial Peace), the by now thoroughly exhausted tourist arrives 
    at the Imperial Gardens and <i>Qinandian</i> (the Hall of Imperial Peace) 
    which lies within. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
    the north of the Imperial Gardens lies <i>Shenwumen</i> (the Northern Gate), 
    which serves today both as an exit and alternative entrance. Yet to enter 
    through the Imperial Gardens, from this side, is to miss the magical key to 
    the entire site.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite 
    the fact that the Imperial City was built as a home for the Emperor, the guiding 
    strategy of its design was to impress - more precisely, to intimidate - those 
    approaching it from without, whether Imperial subjects or foreign visitors. 
    Each &quot;barrier&quot; served as a theatrical display, in a perpetual performance 
    whose only content was the remote grandeur of the Emperor. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    architecture of the Forbidden City is relentlessly turned outwards in an ingenious 
    spectacle of withdrawal. The secret does not lie in what is hidden, but rather 
    in the dramatic exhibition of its concealment. When one finally arrives at 
    the Inner Palace itself, where the Emperor actually lived, along with his 
    wives, concubines and children, it is the comparative modesty and intimacy 
    of scale that is most striking. One feels like an intruder in a &quot;back-stage&quot; 
    area, where the actors and actresses rest between shows, the great illusion 
    momentarily left aside. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Western 
    visitors are reminded of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and the edict: &quot;Do 
    not look behind the curtain.&quot; The comparison becomes even more tempting 
    after learning that the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) did in fact reign 
    from behind a curtain during the penultimate scenes of the Qing regime. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Confronted 
    with these palaces of illusionism a new question arises: Was Imperial China 
    conceived as an immense magic show? </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
    the world of magic is commonly associated with the &quot;occult&quot; and 
    the &quot;hermetic&quot;, with hidden things, when the magician hides something, 
    it is always by showing something else. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was precisely because the Forbidden City was designed to hide the centre of 
    power that it makes no secret of its magical ambitions. It was constructed 
    in rigorous accordance with the principles of <i>feng shui </i>(Chinese geomancy), 
    laying out all buildings on a dominant north-south axis, establishing a large-scale 
    geometrical pattern which -- even today -- dominates the whole of Beijing. 
    The halls and palaces are adorned with mystical animals, imperial phoenixes 
    and lions, clawed turtles symbolizing ancient sorcerous wisdom, cranes symbolizing 
    longevity and countless dragons - paired with phoenixes, playing with pearls 
    and protecting doorways. These legions of mysterious creatures offer themselves 
    as the guards and guides of secret realms and significances. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above 
    all, it is through <i>shushu </i>(the ancient Chinese &quot;art of numbers&quot; 
    or &quot;occult science&quot;) that the magical underpinnings of the Forbidden 
    City still speak. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    magical number of imperial power was nine, the highest decimal numeral, whose 
    numerological and arithmetical features Yongle exploited to the full. The 
    Forbidden City consists of 9,999 rooms, its gates are studded in multiples 
    of nine, the towers guarding it each have nine beams and 18 columns. Yongle 
    even built an artificial mountain in the Imperial Garden, <i>Diuxiushan</i> 
    (the Hill of Accumulated Refinement) topped by <i>Yujingting </i>(the Imperial 
    Viewing Pavilion), dedicated to the <i>Chongyang</i> festival, held on the 
    ninth day of the ninth lunar month. His magical obsession with the number 
    nine reaches its zenith in the circular alter of the <i>Tian Tan</i> (the 
    nearby Temple of Heaven), which consists of nine concentric circles of stone 
    slabs, each in multiples of nine, from nine to 81. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ming 
    Emperor Qianlong followed in these numerological footsteps, erecting the magnificent 
    Nine-Dragon Wall in front of the eastern <i>Huangjimen</i> (the Gate of Ultimate 
    Greatness).</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="dddddd" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern 
    tourists may be tempted to dismiss the magical features of the Forbidden City 
    as mere eccentricities, attesting to the decadence of a ruling elite whose 
    inwardness had detached it from all practical considerations. After all, did 
    Imperial China not fail to exploit the invention of gunpowder for military 
    purposes, blinded by its potential for spectacular effects? Yet, such condescension 
    risks being blinded in turn, missing a crucial lesson of Chinese Imperial 
    history. Magical spectacle may deal in illusions, but illusions can serve 
    as the currency of power. <br>
