  <em>What are "pulp theory/fiction hybrids?" In France - the old old continent 
  - we don't have any kind of cultural studies and " cyber-culture " means nothing. 
  Can you explain your theories in newbies words...</em> 
  <p></p>Many members of the Ccru had 
  fled cultural studies, disgusted by its authoritarian prejudices, its love of 
  ideology, and pompous desire to 'represent the other' or speak on behalf of 
  the oppressed. To us, it never seemed that the real articulacy of the left academic 
  elites was in any way superior to the modes of popular cultural expression which 
  were either ignored or treated as raw material to be probed for a 'true' (ie 
  ideological) meaning by white middle-class intellectuals.<p></p> 
  Ccru has tried to connect and cross-intensify with peripheral cultural processses 
  (dark-side digital audio, cyberpunk, Neolemurian sorcery, numbo-jumbo, Afro-futurism, 
  Indo-futurism, Sino-futurism …). It seeks to think, theorize, and produce with 
  rather than 'about' (or -even worse - 'for') them. We think everything interesting 
  happens on the periphery, outside the standard modes of 'developed' existence. 
  <p></p>Ccru 
  engages with peripheral cultures not because they are 'down-trodden' or oppressed, 
  but because they include the most intense tendencies to social flatness, swarming, 
  populating the future, and contagious positive innovation, hatching the decisive 
  stimuli for the systematic mutation of global cybernetic culture.<p></p> Cyber-culture 
  has come to be synonymous with Internet-studies. Ccru has a more 'fundamentalist' 
  commitment to cybernetics, whose abstract principles of feedback dynamics, nonlinear 
  causality, and machinic involvement are linked to numerous issues concerning 
  digital technology and telecommunications, but in no way restricted to these. <p></p> 
  Ccru has consistently endorsed Deleuze and Guattari's insistence that machines 
  are irreducible to technology. We consider cybernetics to be the practical science 
  of excitement (amplification / inhibition of communication, mutation, and innovation). 
 <p></p> A Ccru list of important influences would include Deleuze and Guattari's two 
  Capitalism and Schizophrenia volumes, with it's 'virtual materialism,' assault 
  upon the privilege of representation, anti-evolutionism, and implacable hostility 
  to the State. Fernand Braudel's rigorous differentiation (and even opposition) 
  between capitalism and the market economy, with 'pro-market anti-capitalism' 
  functioned as a guiding slogan. William Gibson's Cyberspace trilogy, which spreads 
  voodoo into the digital economy, demonstrating (with the Cyberspace Matrix) 
  how a fictional concept makes itself real. Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis novels, 
  for their tentacled aliens, gene-traffic, and decoded sex. Lynn Margulis' bacterial 
  microbiology for outlining the world of destratified life. HPLovecraft's gothic 
  obsessions with time-anomaly, sacred horror of teeming, bubbling, foaming multiplicities 
  … We are currently enthralled by the work of Jacques Vallee and it's extraordinarily 
  sophisticated path to hyperstition through the UFO-phenomenon. <p></p>Ccru is working 
  on a cybergothic 'unnon-fiction' (to steal a term from Steve Beard) which interconnects 
  the history of computing and AI research with UFO-phenomena (alien abduction, 
  false-memory, and cover-ups), secret societies, and esoteric religion, amongst 
  other things.<p></p> Ccru is an ongoing experiment in collectivity, collective production, 
  anonymity, and masks, dedicated to practically dismantling standard models of 
  social existence, by pursuing ethics in the spinozistic sense (experimental 
  production of collective bodies).<p></p> Ccru feeds its own researches back into its 
  own microcultural production. Its basic tool in this respect is 'pulp-theory/fiction 
  hybridity' or Hyperstition (see below).<p></p> 
  2. <em>What were the goals of Virtual Futures, Afro-Futures and Virotechnics?</em> 
  <p></p>These events sought to reinforce and energize 
  the interrelations between elements of theoretical research and popular culture. 
  It was important to us that they were characterized by a minimum of academic 
  stuffiness, and that contemporary sonic culture (techno and jungle) were as 
  thoroughly mixed into proceedings as possible. Ccru particularly encouraged 
  polymedia presentations, involving spoken text, audio, and video or other visuals. 
  <p></p>Our assumption throughout was that philosophy/social theory could be exciting 
  and that the deadening of all visceral response to intellectual exchange was 
  a semi-deliberate strategy serving oppressive social interests. <p></p>The three Virtual 
  Futures conferences were large international events, and thus only diffusely 
  focused. Over the years guests included Manuel Delanda, Pat Cadigan, Stelarc, 
  Scanner, and many others. <p></p>Afro-Futures was a smaller scale event in which members 
  of the Ccru along with key ally Kodwo Eshun explored the interlinkages between 
  peripheral theory, rhythmic systems, and Jungle/Drum&Bass audio. <p></p>Virotechnics 
  was organized outside the academy, and was dedicated to the theme of cross-propagation 
  between cultural viruses and digital technologies.<p></p> 
  3. <em>What is the concept of the the Syzygy hyperstition matrix?</em> 
  <p></p>Syzygy was the title of a five week 'art' 
  show co-produced by Ccru and Orphan Drift. <p></p>The name means 'twinning' or 'twin-system,' 
  and this theme operated as a multilevelled guiding thread. It was during the 
  production of this event that Ccru made contact with the virtual Continentity 
  of Lemuria, which taught us many secrets that we have since attempted to formulate 
  as 'Digital Hyperstition.' <p></p>Digital hyperstition is already widespread, hiding 
  within popular numerical cultures (calendars, currency systems, sorcerous numbo-jumbo, 
  etc.). It uses number-systems for transcultural communication and cosmic exploration, 
  exploiting their intrinsic tendency to explode centralized, unified, and logically 
  overcoded 'master narratives' and reality models, to generate sorcerous coincidences, 
  and to draw cosmic maps. <p></p>The Lemurian biomechanical hyperculture propagates 
  itself through decimal notation, whose latent interconnections are demonstrated 
  in the Numogram (see web-site): an occult diagram of time and practical guide 
  to the ethics of unbelief. An initial attempt to clarify this topic has been 
  made in the most recent issue of our journal Abstract Culture. <p></p>According to 
  the tenets of Hyperstition, there is no difference in principle between a universe, 
  a religion, and a hoax. All involve an engineering of manifestation, or practical 
  fiction, that is ultimately unworthy of belief. Nothing is true, because everything 
  is under production. Because the future is a fiction it has a more intense reality 
  than either the present or the past. Ccru uses and is used by hyperstition to 
  colonize the future, traffic with the virtual, and continually re-invent itself.
