    A Short Prehistory of Ccru </font></h1>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b><br>
    The question of 'the' history of the Ccru is problematic, not least because 
    Ccru activity is characterised by its antagonism towards stable temporality. 
    It's the business of the great sedentary assemblages to establish settled 
    lineages and well-ordered sequences, whereas Ccru-process attaches itself 
    to coincidences, glitches and unforeseen consequences - breaks, twists and 
    bends in time. </b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">History 
    insists upon a linear causal progression - a neat passage from the past (which 
    is already decided) to the future (which is merely the playing out of what 
    has been laid down in the past). Tell me about your mother, then, and I'll 
    understand everything about you. Beyond this causality is another temporality, 
    uncovered at the point where schizonanalysis meets pulp horror. Here, cause 
    does not follow effect: there is a process of retrocontamination in which 
    the deep past finds itself already infected with the far future. The crucial 
    question is one of becoming: what are you changing into, what is growing out 
    of you? Lovecraft, who specialised in narratives that looped the ancient palaeo- 
    past into the far future, did not know that he was already infected with Ccru-virus 
    any more than Ccru can know what strange entities are using its body to incubate 
    the eggs from which they will emerge. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Let's 
    begin at the end, with Ccru's 'latest' publication, Digital Hyperstition. 
    Just now, it's the best place to look for clues as to what Ccru is becoming. 
    Precisely because it is a mass of loose ends, unresolved questions, undecrypted 
    signal. The Digital Hyperstition volume is an unexploded bomb: a text that, 
    in decoding the esoteric traditions of the past, awaits its deployment in 
    the near-future by populations it will itself machine.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Ccru 
    is pleased to announce a deal in which key concepts from Digital Hyperstition 
    have been sold to the games design company, Abstract Machines, who will be 
    weaving them into the architecture of a digital game. From the point of view 
    of the game and its consumers, Ccru is only important as the producer of Digital 
    Hyperstition, and Digital Hyperstition is significant only as a handbook to 
    the game.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
    which case the history of the Ccru would be a prehistory of the game...</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
    Chronos, or conventional linear time, Ccru begins as the Cybernetic Culture 
    Research Unit at the University of Warwick, in K0 +95. But in Chronos, Ccru 
    has never existed. An official statement from the Ccru's former institutional 
    base had it that, &quot;Ccru does not, has not and will never exist.&quot; 
    You could say that the university phase of Ccru's activity was dedicated to 
    its escape from its status as an institutional non-entity. A series of events, 
    including Virtual Futures: Datableed and Afro-Futures in K0 +96, and Virotechnics 
    in K0 +97, and the emergence of the swarm-journal Abstract Culture, functioned 
    as provisional escape-hatches, portals connecting Ccru to the outside of the 
    university where its own future lay. By the time of this year's Syzygy, the 
    event for which Digital Hyperstition was the accompanying publication, the 
    Ccru's institutional history was over before it had begun, and Ccru was well 
    on the way to transforming itself into a rumour mill, an agency of cyber-hype.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Currently, 
    much Ccru activity seems to be dedicated to spreading hype about Y2K. And 
    you'll understand much more about Ccru - and Digital Hyperstition - once you 
    appreciate why it so obsessed with Y2K. So let's say the history of the Ccru 
    begins here, in the - very - near future, with Y2K.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">By 
    now, of course, everyone is familiar with the Y2K - or Millennium Bug - phenomenon. 
    The common perception of Y2K is that it is - merely - an accident. A technical 
    oversight. Not imagining that their programs would still be used come the 
    Year 2000, programmers used a two-digit protocol to code for the date, with 
    the result that, come January 1st, computers still reliant on such programs 
    will be terminally confused, unable to distinguish the year 1900 from the 
    Year 2000. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Ccru 
    learned from cybernetics the lesson that there is nothing 'merely' technical, 
    and sees Y2K as an event exemplifying a whole complex of intermeshing themes, 
    including: the crash of Science Fiction (and the emergence of cyberpunk), 
    the death of postmodernity, and the re-start of chronopolitical conflict.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Y2K 
    is an event that may ultimately be entirely constructed out of hype. But it 
    is only pre-cybernetic nostalgia that could think of hype as something merely 
    illusory ; like panic, which it parallels and bleeds into, hype is an immediately 
    effective cybernetic process, operating by intense feedback spirals. Hype 
    and panic cannot simply be thought of as precursors to events: they are the 
    event already happening. So it's not a matter of waiting for Y2K. As a potential, 
    it's already active. Even if not one computer malfunctions on New Year's Day, 
    Mbug has already been a major disaster for capitalism, of an unprecedented 
    scale. (Estimates of the cost of Y2K to date have gone stratospheric.)</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">So 
    far as Ccru is concerned, this means the crash of Science Fiction. Y2K plugs 
    into the fears that have haunted Science Fiction since its inception: the 
    idea of a human population becoming dependent upon machines over which it 
    has no effective control. As technological integration increases, human control 
    lessens, and the possibility of something crashing the entire system grows. 
    SF disintegrates into cyberpunk.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Where 
    Science Fiction can be defined as the implementation of the project of Progressive 
    Technology - a vision of uninhibited technological growth spreading out into 
    a far future that has been speculatively planned - cyberpunk lurks in the 
    near future, building itself out of the unanticipated consequences of technical 
    development.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">SF 
    conceives of machines in terms of human use-value, thinking of them as (temporarily 
    troublesome) tools with which humanity is ultimately destined to be reconciled 
    . The famous jump-cut in Kubrick's 2001 - from caveman's primitive weapon 
    to gleaming space vehicle - gives you a handy summary of the Science Fictional 
    version of history.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">&gt;From 
    the POV of Y2K, of course, 2001 never happens. And it is almost as if the 
    popular unconscious and Y2K have colluded in the elimination of any date after 
    1999. In the early-to-mid 90s, when Y2K began to emerge as a problem, the 
    year 2000 still seemed as far distant as it did in the 1950s, when programmers 
    agreed upon the two-digit date protocol. In the popular unconscious, the year 
    2000 and beyond belong to the far distant time of Science Fiction - with the 
    ironic effect that SF's long-term has suddenly collapsed into cyberpunk's 
    near future.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Y2K 
    is not only everywhere computers are, it is everywhere silicon chips are: 
    it is a molecular bug, infecting even the tiniest interstices of the technical 
    environment, an invisible invader into technical systems that have themselves 
    tended to shrink out of human sight. It is a global problem that can only 
    be tackled locally. Even if, say, airlines do manage to root out all their 
    Mbug infections, they are still dependent upon agencies who may not have been 
    so successful in debugging their systems. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">So 
    Y2K is not so much a catastrophe as a hyper-catastrophe. Y2K-os can be extrapolated 
    from any number of contingencies and their potential interexcitations: traffic 
    failure, food shortages, ATM malfunction, stock market crashes, exchange of 
    nuclear weapons... Anything that is dependent upon computers is potentially 
    infected with Mbug. Which is bad news for us, who are symbiotically intertwined 
    with them.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Y2K 
    is just one more example of the way in which capitalist reality is indistinguishable 
    from fiction: in capital's world of simulation and cybernetic anticipation, 
    all that is solid has melted into the abstract and virtual. Which is not to 
    subscribe to some melancholy postmodern story about derealization so much 
    as to point to ways in which virtual agencies - such as potentials - have 
    the most material effect imaginable. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Cyberpunk 
    begins with Y2K, but when does Y2K begin? Y2K transforms the dynamics of chaos 
    theory into the logic of fatality. At one level, you couldn't be more precise 
    about when Y2K will happen; at another, it's a massively distributed event, 
    involving the whole century. You could date Y2K at the point, in the 1950s, 
    when the 2-digit protocol was put in place, or at any point since, when the 
    decision to modify it was not taken. As with any fatal loop, ironies abound. 
    It was the military forerunner of the internet, ARPANET, that established 
    the 2-digit dating system. Now, with the Cold War ended, the biggest threat 
    to western security may be a - literal - time-bomb planted by the US military 
    itself some forty years ago.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">When 
    the Economist questioned last year whether two digits can /really mean the 
    end of civilization, it expressed what is a widespread inability to come to 
    terms with the real and effective (not merely signifying or representational) 
    power of signs in cybernetic culture. Y2K is a semiotic event, but it does 
    not belong to postmodernity's regime of signs. Rather, Y2K signals the virtual 
    termination of PoMo. The widespread failure of the academy to offer any effective 
    response to Y2K (or any sort of response at all) is testament to the bankruptcy 
    of its theoretical commitments. It was one thing for out-of-touch theorists 
    to fail to anticipate the events of 1968; but to be unable to respond to Y2K 
    - an event - is an oversight of another magnitude entirely. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The 
    problem is that Y2K scrambles the PoMo radar, discomfiting the by now cosy 
    set of assumptions on which postmodern thought rests. Y2K is culturally-generated 
    but it does not belong to &quot;discourse&quot;; it is a disaster, but it 
    is entirely &quot;unnatural&quot;. The notion of cultural construction to 
    which PoMo is so attached has always carried with it the implicit idea that 
    what has been constructed can be taken apart again. The assumption belongs 
    to a pre-cybernetic opposition between Nature (as the realm of the given) 
    and Culture (as the province of the mutable) that Y2K - like the cybernetic 
    capitalism which has incubated it - is effectively dismantling. Y2K is no 
    less of a catastrophe, and no less ineradicable, because it is totally artificial.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Against 
    the PoMo dictum that signs are arbitrary (and therefore effectively interchangable), 
    Y2K promises that global disaster could be precipitated by a specific semiotic 
    trigger. When next some media pundit yawns about the Year 2000 being an arbitrary 
    date, reflect on the fact that Y2K is happening not on a date, but because 
    of a date. More radically put, the event is the date. At no other point in 
    history have semiotic dating practices themselves caused a catastrophe: when 
    people looked to the skies in trepidation in 999, they didn't imagine that 
    the date itself would bring calamity. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Y2K 
    is simultaneously about friction (between humans and computers) and convergence 
    (of time systems). Things click together on the machinic unconscious just 
    as they fall apart in the social world. At the moment of Y2K, the two-digit 
    convention converges the date with the time: 99 becomes 00 at 00:00 hours 
    precisely. This string of noughts should give pause to PoMo relativists who 
    insists that any sign will do; it is the very precise function of zero that 
    allows Y2K to happen as (and when) it does, effectuating a collision of the 
    Hindu-Arab numeric system with Roman numerals. Although translated into Hindu-Arab 
    numerals, the Gregorian calendar still effectively runs on a Roman numeric 
    system ignorant of zero. Y2K ciphers what will not happen in undebugged cyberspace: 
    the Gregorian Year 2000. Skipping SF's 2000 AD, computers will cyberpunk the 
    date, counting what the Gregorian calendar never has: zero. An anti-PoMo and 
    anti-Gregorian weapon, Y2K quite literally signifies nothing. The effect is 
    a calendric revolution carried out entirely by the machinic unconscious. Unraveling 
    the virtual computer calendar is complicated. When is Y2K's year zero: the 
    Gregorian year 2000, or Greg year 1900? Both are candidates, since, in addition 
    to treating January 1st &quot;2000&quot; as year zero, the implicit computer 
    calendar has retrospectively coded January 1st &quot;1900&quot; as its start-date. 
    And, at the level of the unconscious, anyone logging onto a computer has been 
    in complicity with the computer-calendar. On the darkside of the Net, news 
    is breaking of 00-cults dedicated to the computer-generated calendric system...</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">These 
    denizens of the darkside of cyberspace are practitioners of what Ccru calls 
    digital hyperstition. It's time to look closer at what is involved in this 
    term, and the best place to begin is with one of the writers who have written 
    most extensively on the subject, Iris Carver. </font></b></p>
