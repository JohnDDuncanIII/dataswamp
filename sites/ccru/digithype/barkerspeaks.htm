                  Charles Barker has been Professor of Anorganic Semiotics at 
                  Kingsport College (MVU, Mass.) since 1992. His extraordinary 
                  intellectual achievements resist easy summarization, involving 
                  profound and polymathic engagement across the entire range of 
                  life and earth sciences, in addition to archaeocultural research, 
                  mathematical semiotics, anatomical linguistics, and informatic 
                  engineering. Trained as a cryptographer in the early 1970s, 
                  he has spent his life decoding ancient scripts, quasibiotic 
                  residues, and anomalous mineral patterns (amongst other things). 
                  In late Autumn 1998 Ccru met with Professor Barker in his office 
                  at MVU. The following is an edited transcript of that meeting.

      <p><b><i>Tic-Systems</i></b>. Cryptography has been my guiding thread, right 
        through. What is geotraumatics about, even now? - A rigorous practice 
        of decoding. So I haven't really shifted at all in this respect. There 
        is a voyage, but a strangely immobile one. </p>
                <p>I started out at MIT working in the information sciences - 
                  my thesis proposal was quite conservative, involving mostly 
                  technical issues to do with noise reduction and signal modulation 
                  - but MVU was just getting started, and my research was transferred 
                  across to them. That led to various contacts, and from there 
                  to employment with a NASA-related organization that has particular 
                  interests connected to SETI activity. My task was to help toughen-up 
                  the theoretical basis of their signals analysis. They wanted 
                  to know how to discriminate - in principle - between intelligent 
                  communication and complex pattern derived from nonintelligent 
                  sources. To cut a long story short, it became increasingly obvious 
                  to me that although they said they were hunting for intelligence, 
                  what they were really seeking was organization. The whole program 
                  was fundamentally misguided. Various people had big problems 
                  with the direction of my research, which had basically veered-off 
                  the organizational model. The social friction became intolerable 
                  and I had to leave, which was messy because of my high-level 
                  security clearance ... </p>
                <p>Suborganizational pattern is where things really happen. When 
                  you strip-out all the sedimented redundancy from the side of 
                  the investigation itself - the assumption of intentionality, 
                  subjectivity, interpretability, structure, etc - what remains 
                  are assemblies of functionally interconnected microstimulus, 
                  or tic-systems: coincidental information deposits, seismocryptions, 
                  suborganic quasireplicators (bacterial circuitries, polypoid 
                  diagonalizations, interphase R-Virus, Echo-DNA, ionizing nanopopulations), 
                  plus the macromachineries of their suppression, or depotentiation. 
                  Prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently 
                  abstract and over-theoretical in this regard. They cannot see 
                  the machine for the apparatus, or the singularity for the model. 
                  So tic-systems require an approach that is cosmic-abstract - 
                  hypermaterialist - and also participative, methods that do not 
                  interpret assemblies as concretizations of prior theories, and 
                  immanent models that transmute themselves at the level of the 
                  signals they process. Tic-systems are entirely intractable to 
                  subject/object segregation, or to rigid disciplinary typologies. 
                  There is no order of nature, no epistemology or scientific metaposition, 
                  and no unique level of intelligence. To advance in this area, 
                  which is the cosmos, requires new cultures or - what amounts 
                  to the same - new machines. </p>
                <p>The problem was: how to quantify disorganized multiplicities? 
                  Diagonal, irregular, molecular, and nonmetric quantities require 
                  a scale that is itself nonmetric, that escapes overcoding. Standard 
                  procedures of measurement and classification prove entirely 
                  inadequate, since they presuppose rigid conceptual segmentation 
                  by quantity and quality (Deleuze-Guattari's twin-pincers of 
                  molarity, type and degree). Once things are being worked out 
                  at the level of tic-assemblies - or flat ticking arrays - there 
                  are only intensive populations, and measurement has to give 
                  way to engineering fusional multiplicities: systems that count 
                  themselves only in the way they propagate, immanently numbering 
                  multitudes, like nanoplastic quantum swirls. Eventually a machinic 
                  solution was provided by the Tick-Distributor, but that came 
                  later ... At first there was just the equation, precipitated 
                  in what I still thought to be my own body, virtual tic-density 
                  = geotraumatic tension. </p>
                
      <p><b><i>Geotraumatics</i></b>. I came to Freud relatively late, associating 
        it with oedipal reductionism, and more generally with a psychologistic 
        stance that was simply irrelevant to cryptographic work. It's important 
        to remark here - no doubt we'll get back to this - that everything productive 
        in signals analysis stems from stripping out superfluous prejudices about 
        the source and meaning of complex functional patterns. I took - and still 
        take - the vigorous repudiation of hermeneutics to be the key to theoretical 
        advance in processing sign-systems. It was Echidna Stillwell who helped 
        me to see Freud from the other side. It was a difficult period for me. 
        There had been a lot of painful fall-out from the Nasa work. Psychotherapists 
        were involved, in part attempting to pathologize and discredit my research, 
        and in part responding to real stress-related symptoms. Between the two 
        was a grey zone of traumatic dysfunction and paranoia involving difficult 
        feedback effects. Stillwell persuaded me that the only way to get through 
        this was to try and make sense of it, and that this was not the same as 
        submitting to the interpretative mode. On the contrary. In Beyond the 
        Pleasure Principle, Freud takes a number of crucial initial steps towards 
        mapping the Geocosmic Unconscious as a traumatic megasystem, with life 
        and thought dynamically quantized in terms of anorganic tension, elasticity, 
        or machinic plexion. This requires the anorganizational-materialist retuning 
        of an entire vocabulary: trauma, unconscious, drive, association, (screen-) 
        memory, condensation, regression, displacement, complex, repression, disavowal 
        (e.g. the un- prefix), identity, and person.</p>
                <p>Deleuze and Guattari ask: Who does the Earth think it is? It's 
                  a matter of consistency. Start with the scientific story, which 
                  goes like this: between four point five and four billion years 
                  ago - during the Hadean epoch - the earth was kept in a state 
                  of superheated molten slag, through the conversion of planetesimal 
                  and meteoritic impacts into temperature increase (kinetic to 
                  thermic energy). As the solar-system condensed the rate and 
                  magnitude of collisions steadily declined, and the terrestrial 
                  surface cooled, due to the radiation of heat into space, reinforced 
                  by the beginnings of the hydrocycle. During the ensuing - Archaen 
                  - epoch the molten core was buried within a crustal shell, producing 
                  an insulated reservoir of primal exogeneous trauma, the geocosmic 
                  motor of terrestrial transmutation. And that's it. That's plutonics, 
                  or neoplutonism. It's all there: anorganic memory, plutonic 
                  looping of external collisions into interior content, impersonal 
                  trauma as drive-mechanism. The descent into the body of the 
                  earth corresponds to a regression through geocosmic time. </p>
                
      <p>Trauma is a body. Ultimately - at its pole of maximum disequilibrium 
        - it's an iron thing. At MVU they call it Cthelll: the interior third 
        of terrestrial mass, semifluid metallic ocean, megamolecule, and pressure-cooker 
        beyond imagination. It's hotter than the surface off the sun down there, 
        three thousand clicks below the crust, and all that thermic energy is 
        sheer impersonal nonsubjective memory of the outside, running the plate-tectonic 
        machinery of the planet via the conductive and convective dynamics of 
        silicate magma flux, bathing the whole system in electomagnetic fields 
        as it tidally pulses to the orbit of the moon. Cthelll is the terrestrial 
        inner nightmare, nocturnal ocean, Xanadu: the anorganic metal-body trauma-howl 
        of the earth, cross-hatched by intensities, traversed by thermic waves 
        and currents, deranged particles, ionic strippings and gluttings, gravitational 
        deep-sensitivities transduced into nonlocal electromesh, and feeding vulcanism 
        ... that's why plutonic science slides continuously into schizophrenic 
        delirium. </p>
                <p>Fast forward seismology and you hear the earth scream. Geotrauma 
                  is an ongoing process, whose tension is continually expressed 
                  - partially frozen - in biological organization. For instance, 
                  the peculiarly locked-up lifeforms we tend to see as typical 
                  - those more-or-less obedient to darwinian selection mechanics 
                  - are less than six hundred million years old. They began with 
                  the planetary oxygenization crisis, triggered by the saturation 
                  of crustal iron, followed by mass oxygen-poisoning of the prokaryotic 
                  biosystem and the emergence of a eukaryotic regime. Eukaryotic 
                  cells are highly suppressive. They implement a nuclear command-control 
                  model based on genomic ROM, affined to meiosis-mitosis diplocapture, 
                  hierarchical organization, and multicellular specialization. 
                  Even the distinction between ontogeny and phylogeny - distinct 
                  time-orders of the individual and the species - makes little 
                  sense without eukaryotic nuclear read-only programming and immunological 
                  identity. Evolutionism presupposes specific geotraumatic outcomes. 
                </p>
                
      <p>To take a more recent example, the efflorescence of mammalian life occurs 
        in the wake of the K/T-Missile, which combined with massive magma-plume 
        activity in the Indian Ocean to shut-down the Mesozoic Era, sixty-five 
        million years ago. Irruptive vulcanism plus extraterrestrial impact, linked 
        by coincidence, or plutonic looping. So there is a catastrophic transition 
        to a post-saurian megafauna regime, part of a much larger overall reorganization 
        of terrestrial symptomaticity, providing an index of neohadean resurgence. 
        And what is mammalian life relative to the great saurians? Above all, 
        an innovation in mothering! Suckling as biosurvivalism. Tell me about 
        your mother and you're travelling back to K/T, not into the personal unconscious.

      <p><b><i>Spinal-Catastrophism</i></b>. For humans there is the particular 
        crisis of bipedal erect posture to be processed. I was increasingly aware 
        that all my real problems were modalities of back-pain, or phylogenetic 
        spinal injury, which took me back to the calamitous consequences of the 
        precambrian explosion, roughly five hundred million years ago. The ensuing 
        period is incrementally body-mapped by metazoan organization. Obviously 
        there are discrete quasi-coherent neuromotor tic-flux patterns, whose 
        incrementally rigidified stages are swimming, crawling, and (bipedal) 
        walking. Elaine Morgan persuasively traces the origin of protohuman bipedalism 
        to certain deleterious plate-tectonic shifts. The model is bioseismic. 
        Crustal convulsions and animal body-plan are rigorously interconnected, 
        and the entire Aquatic Ape Theory constitutes an exemplary geotraumatic 
        analysis. Erect posture and perpendicularization of the skull is a frozen 
        calamity, associated with a long list of pathological consequences, amongst 
        which should be included most of the human psychoneuroses. Numerous trends 
        in contemporary culture attest to an attempted recovery of the icthyophidian- 
        or flexomotile-spine: horizontal and impulsive rather than vertical and 
        stress-bearing. </p>
                <p>The issue here - as always - is real and effective regression. 
                  It is not a matter of representational psychology. Consider 
                  Haeckel's widely discredited Recapitulation Thesis, the claim 
                  that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. It is a theory compromised 
                  by its organicism, but its wholesale rejection was an overreaction. 
                  Ballard's response is more productive and balanced, treating 
                  DNA as a transorganic memory-bank and the spine as a fossil 
                  record, without rigid onto-phylogenic correspondence. The mapping 
                  of spinal-levels onto neuronic time is supple, episodic, and 
                  diagonalizing. It concerns plexion between blocks of machinic 
                  transition, not strict isomorphic - or stratic redundancy - 
                  between scales of chronological order. Mammal DNA contains latent 
                  fish-code (amongst many other things).</p>
                
      <p><b><i>Palate-Tectonics</i></b>. Due to erect posture the head has been 
        twisted around, shattering vertebro-perceptual linearity and setting-up 
        the phylogenetic preconditions for the face. This right-angled pneumatic-oral 
        arrangement produces the vocal-apparatus as a crash-site, in which thoracic 
        impulses collide with the roof of the mouth. The bipedal head becomes 
        a virtual speech-impediment, a sub-cranial pneumatic pile-up, discharged 
        as linguo-gestural development and cephalization take-off. Burroughs suggests 
        that the protohuman ape was dragged through its body to expire upon its 
        tongue. Its a twin-axial system, howls and clicks, reciprocally articulated 
        as a vowel-consonant phonetic palette, rigidly intersegmented to repress 
        staccato-hiss continuous variation and its attendant becomings-animal. 
        That's why stammerings, stutterings, vocal tics, extralingual phonetics, 
        and electrodigital voice synthesis are so laden with biopolitical intensity 
        - they threaten to bypass the anthropostructural head-smash that establishes 
        our identity with logos, escaping in the direction of numbers. </p>
      <p><b><i>Barker Numbering</i></b>. Once numbers are no longer overcoded, 
        and thus released from their metric function, they are freed for other 
        things, and tend to become diagrammatic. From the beginning of my tic-systems 
        work the most consistent problems have concerned intensive sequences. 
        Sequence is not order. Order already supposes a doubling, a level of redundancy: 
        the sequenced sequence. A decoded sequence is something else, a sheer 
        numeracy prior to any insertion into chronologic structure. That's why 
        decoding number implies an escape from assumptions of progressive time. 
        Tick multitudes arrive in convergent waves, without subordination to chronology, 
        history, or linear causation. They proceed by infolding, involution, or 
        implex. It's a matter of convergence, and numbers do that, once they're 
        free to. So the first stage required plexive introgression of the tic-density 
        scale, which was numerically rigorized as digital twinning. Treat the 
        decimal numerals as a set of 9-sum twins - zygonovize - and they map an 
        abstract intensive wave, indifferent to magnitude. Everything efficient 
        about digital reduction is concerned with this, since it discovers the 
        key to decimal syzygetic complementarity: 9 = 0. A flattening down to 
        disordered sequentiality, or abstract numerical implex. Nine is the ultimate 
        decimal numeral, operating as positive (or full-body) zero. It is the 
        abstract numeric product of the decimal-magnitude minus one (infinitesimalized 
        as 1 = 0.999... reiterating), which relates to a particular mode of proliferation 
        within capitalist semiotics (of the type $99.99). </p>
      <p><i><b>Barker-Spiral</b></i>. The pattern really came together with the 
        Diplozygotic Spiral, which arrived suddenly, by chance. I was playing 
        a game of Decadence, which I had first encountered many years before. 
        This game already interested me because of its numerical elegance, its 
        complex associations, and its dependence upon a principle of decimal twinning. 
        It had always seemed to hint at a lost syzygetic arithmetism, related 
        to the bilateral symmetry of the human body. Digits are fingers, and they 
        come in decimal packages of two times five. In Decadence five makes ten 
        by doubling, or pairing with itself, scoring zero. This tantalized me, 
        but I couldn't fit it together theoretically. The quandary was unlocked 
        on this occasion, when one of the participants casually mentioned the 
        existence of an occulted variation of the game, called Subdecadence, based 
        on a system of nine-sum twinning. Subdecadence introduces zeroes, and 
        nine-zero twins. It works by zygonovic numerism. That was stunning enough 
        in itself, but seeing the two together - or seeing between them - was 
        an incredible moment of diagrammatic assemblage. It all spontaneously 
        condensed, and the Spiral clicked into coherence, like a secret door into 
        the long-hidden crypt of the decimal system.</p>
