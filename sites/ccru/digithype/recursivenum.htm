                  ) <i><b>Nonlinear additive series in African cultures</b></i>. 
                  The counting numbers (1,2,3...) can be thought of as a kind 
                  of iteration, but only in the most trivial way. It is true that 
                  we could produce the counting numbers from a recursive loop; 
                  that is, a function in which the output at one stage becomes 
                  the input for the next: X n + 1 - X n + 1 . But this is a strictly 
                  linear series, increasing by the same amount each time -- the 
                  numeric equivalent of a staircase. Addition can, however, produce 
                  nonlinear series, and there are at least two examples of nonlinear 
                  additive series in African cultures. The triangular numbers 
                  (1,3,6,10,15...) are used in a game called "tarumbeta" in east 
                  Africa (Zaslavsky 1973 pp. 11 1 ). Figure 1 shows how these 
                  numbers are derived from the shape of triangles of increasing 
                  size, and how the numeric series can be created by a recursive 
                  loop. As in the case of certain formal age-grade initiation 
                  practices, the simple versions are used by smaller children, 
                  and the higher iterations picked up with increasing age. While 
                  there is no indication of a formal relationship in this instance, 
                  there is still an underlying parallel between the iterative 
                  concept of aging common to many Africa cultures -- each individual 
                  passing through multiple turns of the "life-cycle" -- and the 
                  iterative nature of the triangular number series.</font></font></font></div>

      Another nonlinear additive series in was found in archaeological evidence 
      from north Africa. Badawy (1965) noted what appears to be use of the Fibonacci 
      series in the layout of the temples of ancient Egypt. Using a slightly different 
      approach, I found a visually distinct example of this series in the successive 
      chambers of the temple of Karnak, as shown in figure 2a. Figure 2b shows 
      how these numbers can be generated using a recursive loop. This formal scaling 
      plan may have been derived from the non-numeric versions of scaling architecture 
      we see throughout Africa (cf. Eglash 1995, Eglash et al 1994). <p>An ancient 
      set of balance weights, apparently used in Egypt, Syria and Palestine circa 
      1200 B.C.E., also appear to employ the Fibonacci sequence (Petruso 1985). 
      This is a particularly interesting use, since one of the striking mathematical 
      properties of the sequence is that one can create any positive integer through 
      addition of selected members -- a property that makes it ideal for application 
      to balance measurements (Hoggatt 1969 pp 7f). There is no evidence that 
      ancient Greek mathematicians knew of the Fibonacci sequence. There was use 
      of the Fibonacci sequence in Minoan design, but Preziosi (1968) cites evidence 
      indicating that this could have been brought from Egypt by Minoan architectural 
      workers employed at Kahun.  <p>2) <i><b>Discrete self organization in Owari</b></i>  <p>Figure 
      3a shows a board game that is played throughout Africa in many different 
      versions variously termed "ayo," "bao," "giuthi," "lela," "mancala," "omweso," 
      "owari," "tei," and "songo" (among many other names). Boards cut into stones, 
      some of extreme antiquity, have been found from Zimbabwe to Ethopia (see 
      Zaslavsky 1973 figure 11-6). The game is played by scooping pebble or seed 
      counters from one cup, and sequentially placing one each in the cups that 
      follow. The goal is to have the last counter land in a cup with only one 
      or two counters already in it, which allows the player to capture those 
      counters. In the Ghanaian game of Owari, players are known for utilizing 
      a series of moves they call a "marching group." They note that if the number 
      of counters in a series of cups each decrease by one (e.g. 4-3-2-1 ) the 
      entire pattern can be replicated with a right-shift by scooping from the 
      largest cup, and that if left uninterrupted it can propagate in this way 
      as far as needed (figure 3b). As simple as it seems, this concept of a self 
      replicating pattern is at the heart of some sophisticated mathematical concepts. 
       <p>John von Neumann, who played a pivotal role in the development of the modern 
      digital computer, was also a founder of the mathematical theory of self 
      organizing systems. Initially von Neumann's theory was to be based on self 
      reproducing physical robots. Why work on a theory of self reproducing machines? 
      I believe the answer can be found in von Neumann's social outlook. Heims' 
      (1984) biography emphasizes how the disorder of von Neumann's precarious 
      youth as a Hungarian Jew was reflected in his adult efforts to impose a 
      strict mathematical order in various aspects of the world. In von Neumann's 
      application of game theory to social science, for example, Heims writes 
      that his "Hobbesian" assumptions were "conditioned by the harsh political 
      realities of his Hungarian existence." His enthusiasm for the use of nuclear 
      weapons against the Soviet Union is also attributed to this experience. 
       <p>During the Hixon Symposium (von Neumann 1951 ) he was asked if computing 
      machines could be built such that they could repair themselves if "damaged 
      in air raids," and replied that "there is no doubt that one can design machines 
      which, under suitable circumstances, will repair themselves." His work on 
      nuclear radiation tolerance for the AEC in 1954-5 included biological effects 
      as well as machine operation. Putting these facts together, I cannot escape 
      the creepy conclusion that von Neumann's interest in self-reproducing automata 
      originated in fantasies about having a more perfect mechanical progeny survive 
      the nuclear purging of organic life on this planet.  <p>Models for physical 
      robots turned out to be too complex, and at the suggestion of his colleague 
      Stanislaw Ulam, von Neumann settled for a graphic abstraction; "cellular 
      automata" as they came to be called. In this model (figure 4a) each square 
      in a grid is said to be either alive or dead (that is, in one of two possible 
      states). The iterative rules for changing the state of any one square are 
      based on the eight nearest neighbors (e.g. if 3 or more nearest-neighbors 
      are full, the cell becomes full in the next iteration). At first researchers 
      carried out on these cellular automata experiments on checkered table cloths 
      with poker chips and dozens of human helpers (Mayer-Kress, personal communication), 
      but by 1970 it had been developed into a simple computer program (Conway's 
      "game of life") which was described by Martin Gardner in his famous "Mathematical 
      Games" column in Scientific American. The "game of life" column was an instant 
      hit, and computer screens all over the world began to pulsate with a bizarre 
      array of patterns (figure 4b). As these activities drew increasing professional 
      attention, a wide range of mathematically-oriented scientists began to realize 
      that the spontaneous emergence of self sustaining patterns created in certain 
      cellular automata were excellent models for the kinds of self organizing 
      patterns that had been so elusive in studies of fluid flow and biological 
      growth.  <p>Since scaling structures are one of the hallmarks of both fluid 
      turbulence and biological growth, the occurrence of fractal patterns in 
      cellular automata attracted a great deal of interest. But more simple scaling 
      structure, the logarithmic spiral (figure 5), has garnered much of the attention. 
      Even back in the 1950s mathematician Alan Turing, whose theory of computation 
      provided von Neumann with the inspiration for the first digital computer, 
      began his research on "biological morphogenesis" with an analysis of logarithmic 
      spirals in growth patterns. Markus (1991) notes that the application areas 
      for cellular automata models of spiral waves include nerve axons, the retina, 
      the surface of fertilized eggs, the cerebral cortex, heart tissue, and aggregating 
      slime molds. In the text for CALAB, the first comprehensive software for 
      experimenting with cellular automata, mathematician Rudy Rucker ( 1989, 
      pp. 168) refers to systems which produce paired log spirals as "Zhabotinsky 
      CAs," after the chemist who first observed such self organizing patterns 
      in artificial media:  <p>"When you look at Zhabotinsky CAs, you are seeing 
      very striking three dimensional structures; things like paired vortex sheets 
      in the surface of a river below a dam, the scroll pair stretching all the 
      way down to the river bottom.... In three dimensions, a Zhabotinsky reaction 
      would be like two paired nautilus shells, facing each other with their lips 
      blending. The successive layers of such a growing pattern would build up 
      very like a fetus!"   <p>Figure 6 shows how the owari marching group system 
      can be used as a one-dim~nsional cellular automaton to demonstrate many 
      of the dynamic phenomena produced on two-dimensional systems. The Akan and 
      other Ghanaian societies had a remarkable pre-colonial use of logarithmic 
      spirals in iconic representations for self organizing systems (figure 7a). 
      The Ghanaian spirals and the four-armed computer graphic in figure 5b are 
      quite distant in terms of the machine technologies that produced produced 
      them, but there may well be mathematical connections between the two. Since 
      cellular automata model the emergence of such patterns in modern scientific 
      studies of living systems, and certain Ghanaian log spiral icons were also 
      intended as generalized models for organic growth, it is not unreasonable 
      to consider the possibility that the self organizing dynamics observable 
      in owari were also linked to concepts of biological morphogenesis in traditional 
      Ghanaian knowledge systems.  <p>Rattray's classic volume on the Asante culture 
      of Ghana includes a chapter on owari, but unfortunately it only covers the 
      rules and strategies of the game. Recently Kofi Agudoawu (1991) of Ghana 
      has written a booklet on owari "dedicated to Africans who are engaged in 
      the formidable task of reclaiming their heritage," and he does note its 
      association with reproduction: "wari" in the Ghanaian language Twi means 
      "he/she marries." Herskovits ( 1930), noting that the "awari" game played 
      by the descendants of African slaves in the new world had retained some 
      of the pre-colonial cultural associations from Africa, reports that awari 
      had a distinct "sacred character" to it, particularly involving the carving 
      of the board. Owari boards with carvings of logarithmic spirals (figure 
      7b) can be commonly found in Ghana today, suggesting that western scientists 
      may not be the only ones who developed an association between discrete self-organizing 
      patterns and biological reproduction. It is a bit vindictive, but I can't 
      help enjoying the thought of von Neumann, apostle of a mechanistic New World 
      Order that would wipe out the irrational cacophony of living systems, spinning 
      in his grave every time we watch a cellular automaton -- whether in pixels 
      or owari cups -- bring forth chaos in the games of life.  <p><b>References</b>  <p>Agudoawu,
