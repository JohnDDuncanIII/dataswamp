      I think now, looking back, that the dreams' return can be dated to 1925, 
      the moment of my arrival in the Sunda Strait. It began as insidious seepage, 
      waves of vaguely familiar but disconnected fragments, whose secret cohesion 
      I could dimly perceive. <p>I had been drawn to the Mu N'Ma by their reputed 
      traditions of dream-sorcery, which offered a singular opportunity for converting 
      my studies of Freud and Frazer into practical field work. Although it might 
      seem ironical that a student of Freud could be so oblivious to their subterranean 
      motivations, I shared with my generation a profound and unquestioning faith 
      in the spirit of objective scientific inquiry, and little suspected (or 
      had forgotten) the deeper currents guiding a lifelong interest in the phenomena 
      of dreams. <p>The N'Ma people had gained some public noteriety through their 
      role in the strange case of Cecil Curtis. I myself had first learned of 
      the Mu through tantalising references in the burgeoning literature that 
      had transformed the events of Curtis' ill-fated expedition into something 
      of a modern myth. Most of these accounts had underplayed the role of the 
      two other tribes in the N'Ma system, but the occasional hint about the Mu 
      and their dream rites was more than sufficient to provoke in me an interest 
      that would quickly shade into obsession.<p> By the time I arrived in Indonesia, 
      the tripartite N'Ma system was in shreds . In totally annihilating one tribe 
      - Curtis's Tak N'Ma - and all but destroying another - the Dib N'Ma - the 
      1883 explosion of Krakatoa had wrecked the complex web of social exchange 
      on which the Mu had traditonally depended. An atmosphere of terrible desolation 
      overhung them, and I could be under no illusion that the Mu were little 
      more than a shadow of what they had been in the days prior to the cataclysm. 
      These were a haunted people, whose continuing survival seemed a dubious 
      blessing at best. <p>In this apocalyptic atmosphere, it was inevitable that 
      my thoughts should increasingly turn to the days immediately preceding the 
      catastrophe, and to its herald, Cecil Curtis. Following Curtis's footsteps 
      into N'Ma territory, I read the famous few surviving fragments of his journal 
      with a renewed sense of puzzlement and disquiet. <p>None of the speculations 
      on Curtis' final days had, to my mind, adequately made sense of the peculiar 
      trajectory his delirium took. The lay observer might be tempted to think 
      his words mere ravings, but for those, like myself, who had fallen under 
      Freud's spell, the compulsion to search for the hidden logics that guide 
      and structure supposedly random manias is irresistable. What dark events 
      coalesced to produce Curtis' madness? I read key passages over and over 
      again:<p> <i>17th July 1883.<br>
 I know now that I will never leave this place. The 
      jungle is rotting me into nothingness. My supplies are exhausted. Clouds 
      of mosquitoes torment me and I am plagued by the pounding, crushing, smothering 
      heat. </i><p><i>28th July 1883.<br>
 I have broken from everything, in any case participated 
      in something abominable ... behind the tattered masks of man and God.<br>
 Christian 
      civilization is no better than the prancing of savages ... <br>
How could human 
      fellowship exist after this?</i><p> By now, the Tak N'Ma's ferocity is legendary: 
      they were "the most unspeakable savages on earth", according to one of Curtis's 
      less ethnographically sensitive biographers. The same source remarked that 
      the Tak N'Ma rites "could not be contemplated by any decent Christian without 
      risk of the loss of his mind." These practices, coupled with the ravages 
      of the malaria which afflicted Curtis in his final days, would have been 
      enough to completely unhinge any European male, even one as famously thick-skinned 
      as Cecil 'Mad Dog' Curtis. But Curtis seemed, in the end, to confront an 
      awful revelation whose enormous horror could not be reduced to these two 
      factors; rather, the disease and the Tak rituals were themselves, he seemed 
      to imply, part of some senseless pattern in which his whole life was always 
      fated to be engulfed.<p> <i>24th August 1883.<br>
 Needless to say, the Limbic Key continues 
      to elude me. I strongly suspect it is a fiction. The Order are pursuing 
      a chimera - the sense of destiny has not departed, however. On the contrary, 
      I was meant to be here, irrespective of the motives of those who sent me. 
      Other forces were at work. I have been chosen since the beginning of time.<br>
 
      Curse this blasphemous fate.</i><p> My daytime obsession with Curtis transferred 
      easily into dreams in which Curtis featured heavily; in terribly vivid nightmares 
      I sometimes felt I was meeting Curtis; at other times, I had the uncanny 
      conviction that I was seeing the jungle landscape through his fever-darkened 
      eyes. Given the circumstances, these nocturnal encounters were hardly unmotivated, 
      but the dreams had a naggingly intimate quality about them. As if I had 
      experienced them them many times before, and was only now remembering them.<p> 
      The intense, oppressively subdued atmosphere that benighted Mu N'Ma culture 
      was in every way at odds with the excitement that leapt into my heart as 
      I learned more about it. It was immediately evident that Mu culture was 
      indeed based upon a system of dream magic, in which the Nago - or dream 
      witch - occupied an exalted position. The Nago fulfills a wide-ranging oracular 
      function in Mu culture. Medicine, the settlement of disputes, advice and 
      counsel; all are in the Dream Witch's power. Those who sought her wisdom 
      would make solitary pilgrimages to the temple, bearing appropriate gifts. 
      A simple ritual follows, during which they offer sacrifices and make requests. 
      On the night following - it is said - they receive a <i>Nagwi</i> or dream visit. <p>
      It is said of the Nago that she never speaks, except in dreams. <p>When I asked 
      to visit the Nago, the Mu elders merely nodded, showing neither enthusiasm 
      nor hostility. They greeted my entreaty with the same sense of fated inevitabilty 
      with which they seemed to accept all matters. <p>The Nago's temple is located 
      on the side of a cliff, an hour's trek through thick jungle. Fittingly for 
      a people whose deity, Mur Mur, is a sea creature - a "dreaming serpent", 
      it is sometimes said - the temple looks out upon the ocean. As I was guided 
      through the primeval vegetation, I thought once more of Cecil Curtis and 
      the Tak N'Ma. <p><i>11th August 1883.<br>
 The language of these savages is impenetrable. 
      They now promise to 'take me to Katak.' To meet myself, therefore! Or perhaps 
      a rabid dog!!</i> <p>The fatal irony of this entry has often been remarked upon 
      by commentators. Curtis would only understand the N'Ma's taxonomy too late. 
      Curtis's Christian thinking would have been little assistance in unravelling 
      the Tak belief system; the fact that the Tak's god, Katak, was manifested 
      in dogs, volcanoes and indeed Curtis himself could only appear nonsensical 
      to a man of his time and background. Curtis must have at first assumed that 
      the Tak's apparent reverence for him was the natural response of "savages" 
      to their "betters." He could not have suspected, as he was annointed by 
      the Taks, that he was destined to be the sacrificial harbinger of the Taks' 
      ultimate destruction. Perhaps it was only towards the end that he realised 
      that his arrival and the apocalyptic eruption of Krakatoa had always been 
      coincident in Tak folklore: their tribal stories said that "the Fiery End" 
      would be the heralded by the arrival of the "white Katak" - 'Mad Dog' Curtis.<p> 
      <i>27th August 1883.<br>
 The fever has melted away the walls between waking and 
      sleep. Consciousness has become a loathsome fog. I sense that the incessant 
      rumbling of volcanic activity is connected with the visions that plague 
      me constantly now .... it felt as if I were carried down my spine .... Things 
      ancient beyond imagination .... beyond the ultimate gate of ruin and insanity 
      ... oceans of subterranean fire ...</i><p> So Curtis' final days became a veritable 
      journey into hell. The Curtis biography I had with me in Indonesia contained 
      facsimiles of the journal, showing a marked decline in the handwriting. 
      By the end, the hand was so spidery that one was almost tempted to query 
      the attribution - could this barely legible scrawl have been produced by 
      the same individual? <p>My head still full of Curtis, I was led into the Vault 
      of Murmurs, the sacred cavern below the Nago temple in which the Dream Witch 
      receives her supplicants. The Nago sat at the other end of the grotto, folded 
      into its deep shadows. Feeling a sense of uncanny familiarity, I asked the 
      inevitable question. "Where was Curtis taken?" The Nago nodded, and left, 
      her silence unbroken, in accordance with custom. <p>The next morning, I awoke 
      to a feeling of immense anti-climax. I ransacked my mind for traces of the 
      previous night's dreams, recalling nothing. Yet through this almost painful 
      disappointment, older memories surfaced, dating - I sensed with icy certainty 
      - from my seventh year. It was the night of the Century's Eve, 31st December, 
      1899. (No Freudian scholar can miss the significance of the year 1899 - 
      the date of the first publication of <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>.)<p> A female 
      voice spoke. "Echidna, Echidna, wake up." I had assumed - "previously", 
      if such a time-designation makes any sense - that this was the voice of 
      my mother. Now I knew it was the voice of the Nago, speaking to in my own 
      tongue. But I was no longer sure to whom - or what - it was addressed. I 
      was entirely carried away. My body felt impossible. Touching my face, I 
      encountered only the features and limbs of a little girl. Below the waist, 
      however, all was confusion, snaking endlessly into itself, or rather, into 
      depths beyond sense, traversed by languid spinal waves that culminated in 
      a distant hint of a tail. <p>My dream body floated in what appeared to be an 
      undersea cavern. As I lay there, I beheld, moving toward me with grim purpose, 
      a raft carrying a solemn, spectral party. I recognised, from the many books 
      recounting the Curtis legend, the crimson markings and ceremonial masks 
      of the Tak N'Ma. And on the raft with them - reclining in a malarial swoon, 
      dressed in Tak ritual garb - was the unmistakable figure of Cecil Curtis. 
      They were bringing him to me. <p>Except I was dissolving, becoming indistinguishable 
      from the water which held me. And when I turned again to where Curtis had 
      been but a moment ago, I heard only anguished gargles: the growls and snarls 
      of some creature that seemed to be part dog, part cat, barely human. I felt 
      claws in what should have been my side. Then there was a plume of blood 
      which I at first thought was mine, but when I looked again, I saw it gouting 
      from the other creature's flesh, which, I was suddenly aware, was becoming 
      absorbed into me - even as my body was losing any sense of its limits.<p> Warped 
      perceptions danced past my dream eyes. Darting acceleration and abyssal 
      slowness fused in a wholly unfamiliar time-sense. I suddenly became aware 
      of the cyclopean edifices of a lost civilization; though "civilization" 
      scarcely seemed the word for the alien vistas that swam before me, swarming 
      city-shoals quivering with a wholly inorganic animation.<p> Something told 
      me, a whisper or an intuition - in that dreaming ocean both blended utterly 
      - that this was the lost continent of Lemuria, speculated upon by contemporary 
      archaeologists and mystics. What was left of my mammal body flickered out 
      of focus; it felt clumsy - all fingers and thumbs. As I looked down at my 
      hands, they became transluscent, and I saw, inscribed into the impossible 
      geometries of the dream cave's wall beyond, an arrangement of ten circles, 
      a number of smaller circles, and a series of interconnecting lines. <p>This 
      was my first encounter with what came to be called the Numogram. It was 
      only later that I was able to uncover the numeric relations encrypted in 
      its ancient patterns - the dream showed me only the shapes and their relations. 
      But, even in those early, hallucinatory minutes, as I made my first hurried 
      transcriptions of the dream-image, I knew that I had in front of me a key 
      that would unlock all the secrets of my life. A labyrinth had opened up, 
      a labyrinth whose complexities could be contained no more by our supernaturalisms 
      than by our sciences. It was a labyrinth in which my fate - and that of 
      the N'Ma, Cecil Curtis, and more cosmic presences - had always been tangled 
      together. I was unravelled in this maze of coincidences, and could do nothing 
      but follow its threads forever. <p>
	  
	  <b>1. Numogram and Otz Chaiim.</b>
	  <p> To those familiar 
      with the Western Magical Tradition, it is likely that the Numogram will 
      initially evoke the Qabbalistic Tree of Life. Both are constructed as decimal 
      diagrams, involving webs of connectivity between ten basic zones, mysteriously 
      twisted into a cryptic ultra-cycle (that links upper and lower regions). 
      Both treat names as numbers, and numerize by digital reduction and cumulation. 
      Both include passages across abysmal waters and through infernal regions. 
      Both map zones onto spinal levels. <p>Despite these manifold interlinkages, 
      there are compelling reasons to consider the Tree of Life a scrambled variant 
      of the Numogram, rather than a parallel system. During its long passage 
      through Atlantean and post-Atlantean hermetic traditions the systematic 
      distortions of the Numogram (introduced to confuse the uninitiated) gradually 
      hardened into erroneous doctrines, and a dogmatic image of the Tree. Most 
      evidently, a vulgar distribution of the numbers - in their exoteric counting-order 
      - was substituted (redundantly) for the now esoteric numogrammatical distribution, 
      which proceeds in accordance with immanent criteria (the web emerging qabbalisitically 
      from the zone-numbers themselves). More devastatingly, the orginal consistency 
      of numeracy and language seems to have been fractured at an early stage, 
      introducing a division between the number of the Sephiroth (10) and that 
      of the Hebrew alphabet (22). The result was a break between the nodes of 
      the tree and the interconnecting paths, ruining all prospect of decipherment. 
      The Sephiroth -segmented over-aganist their connections - become static 
      and structural, whilst the paths lose any rigorous principle of allocation. 
      A strictly analogous outcome is evident in the segmentation of the Tarot 
      into Major and Minor Arcana. Increasingly desperate, arbitrary, and mystifying 
      attempts to re-unite the numbers and their linkages seems to have bedevilled 
      all succeeding occult traditions. <p><b>2. Numogram and I Ching</b>. <p> There is considerable 
      evidence, both immanent and historical, that the Chinese I Ching and the 
      Nma numogram share a hypercultural matrix. Both are associated with intricate 
      zygonomies, or double-numbering systems, and process abstract problematics 
      involving subdivisions of decimal arrays (as suggested by the Ten Wings 
      of traditional I Ching commentary). Digital reduction of binary powers stabilizes 
      in a six-step cycle (with the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5). These steps correspond 
      to the lines of the hexagram, and to the time-circuit zones of the Numogram, 
      producing a binodecimal 6-Cycle (which is also generated in reverse by quintuplicative 
      numbering). In both cases a supplementary rule of pairing is followed, according 
      to a zygonovic criterion (9-twinning of reduced values: 8:1, 7:2, 5:4, mapping 
      the hexagram line pairs). <p>The numogram time-circuit, or I Ching hexagam, 
      implictly associates zero with the set of excluded triadic values. It is 
      intriguing in this respect that numerous indications point to an early struggle 
      between triadic and binary numbering practices in ancient chinese culture, 
      suggesting that the binary domination of decimal numeracy systematically 
      produces a triadic residue consistent with nullity. The hexagram itself 
      exhibits obvious tension in this respect, since it reinserts a triadic hyperfactor 
      into the reduced binodigital set (compounded by its summation to twenty-seven, 
      or the third power of three). <p>An ancient binotriadic parallel to the I Ching, 
      called the T'ai Hsuan Ching (or <i>Book of the Great Dark</i>) consisted of eighty-one 
      tetragrams, reversing the relation of foregrounded and implicit numerical 
      values. The division of Lao Tse's Tao Te Ching into eighty-one sections 
      suggests that this numerical conflict was an animating factor in the early 
      history of Taoism. <p><b>3. Ethnography of the Nma</b>. <p>Nma culture cannot be decoded 
      without the key provided by the Lemurian Time-Maze. The influence of a hyper 
      triadic criterion of time is evident in the relics of Nma kinship organization, 
      calendrics, and associated rituals. Prior to the calamity of 1883, the Nma 
      consisted of true tribes (tripartite macrosocial divisions). They were distributed 
      in a basic tridentity (interlocking large-scale groupings into Tak- Mu- 
      and Dib-Nma), supported by a triangular patrilocal marriage-cycle. Each 
      marriage identified a woman with a numogram current, or time-passage. (Tak-Nma 
      women marrying into the Mu-Nma, Mu-Nma ditto Dib-Nma, Dib-Nma ditto Tak-Nma). 
      The common calendar of all three tribes was based upon a zygotriadic system 
      (using 6 digits to divide a double-year period of 729 days into fractional 
      powers of three). The Mu-Nma still employ such a calendar today. (The current 
      Mu-Nma calendar is adjusted by regular intercalations of three additional 
      days every second cycle, or four years. The earlier practice of intercalations 
      is not easily recoverable). <p>In the rituals of the Nma the time-circuit is 
      concretized as a hydro-cycle: a division and recombination of the waters. 
      The three stages of this recurrent transmutation are, 1) the undivided waters 
      (oceanic), 2) cloud-building (evaporation), and 3) down-pour (precipitation, 
      river-flow). These are associated with the great sea-beast ( Mur Mur), the 
      lurker of steaming swamps ( Oddubb), and that which hunts amongst the raging 
      storms ( Katak). The cycle is closed by a return to the abysmal waters, 
      intrinsically linking the order of time, and its recurrence, to an ultimate 
      cataclysm (prior to any opposition of cyclic and apocalyptic time). It is 
      in this context that the transcultural deluge-mythos can be restored to 
      its aboriginal sense (which also corresponds to the Hindu Trimurti, with 
      its three stages of creation, preservation and destruction). </font></font><!-- #EndEditable --> </font></td>
