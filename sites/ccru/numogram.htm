      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pandemonium is 
        the complete system of Lemurian demonism and time sorcery. It consists 
        of two principal components: Numogram (time-map) and Matrix (listing the 
        names, numbers and attributes of the demons). </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The system is constructed 
        according to immanent criteria latent in decimal numeracy, and involves 
        only basic arithmetical operations (assembled from additions and subtractions). 
        </font> </b> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Numogram, or 
        Decimal Labyrinth, is composed of ten zones (numbered 0-9) and their interconnections. 
        These zones are grouped into five pairs (syzygies) by nine-sum twinning 
        [zygonovism]. The arithmetical difference of each syzygy defines a current 
        (or connection to a tractor zone). Currents constitute the primary flows 
        of the numogram. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each zone number 
        when digitally cumulated defines the value of a gate, whose reduction 
        sets the course of a corresponding channel. Channels constitute the secondary 
        flows, time-holes, or secret interconnections of the numogram.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The arrangement 
        of currents divides the Maze into three basic time-systems. Firstly, the 
        currents of the three central syzygies mutually compose a cycle, rotating 
        in anticlockwise steps. Lemurian sorcery calls this inner loop the Time-Circuit. 
        Secondly, and thirdly, in both the Upper and the Lower syzygies the currents 
        produced fold back into (a half of) themselves, constituting autonomous 
        loops: the Warp (upper), and Plex (lower). Warp and Plex circuitries are 
        of an intrinsically cryptic nature, which is compounded by the enigmas 
        of their interconnection. They are variously considered to be Outside- 
        or Outer-time.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gates and their 
        channels knit the Maze together, providing connections between otherwise 
        incompatible time-systems. They open and close the ways of sorcerous traffic. 
        Although each gate deranges time in its own way, their operations vary 
        with a certain regional consistency. <br>
        </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <i>Numogram 
        and Otz Chaiim</i>. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To those familiar 
        with the Western Magical Tradition, it is likely that the Numogram will 
        initially evoke the Qabbalistic Tree of Life. Both are constructed as 
        decimal diagrams, involving webs of connectivity between ten basic zones, 
        mysteriously twisted into a cryptic ultra-cycle (that links upper and 
        lower regions). Both treat names as numbers, and numerize by digital reduction 
        and cumulation. Both include passages across abysmal waters and through 
        infernal regions. Both map zones onto spinal levels.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite these manifold 
        interlinkages, there are compelling reasons to consider the Tree of Life 
        a scrambled variant of the Numogram, rather than a parallel system. During 
        its long passage through Atlantean and post-Atlantean hermetic traditions 
        the systematic distortions of the Numogram (introduced to confuse the 
        uninitiated) gradually hardened into erroneous doctrines, and a dogmatic 
        image of the Tree.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Most evidently, 
        a vulgar distribution of the numbers - in their exoteric counting-order 
        - was substituted (redundantly) for the now esoteric numogrammatical distribution, 
        which proceeds in accordance with immanent criteria (the web emerging 
        qabbalisitically from the zone-numbers themselves). More devastatingly, 
        the orginal consistency of numeracy and language seems to have been fractured 
        at an early stage, introducing a division between the number of the Sephiroth 
        (10) and that of the Hebrew alphabet (22). The result was a break between 
        the nodes of the tree and the interconnecting paths, ruining all prospect 
        of decipherment. The Sephiroth -segmented over-aganist their connections 
        - become static and structural, whilst the paths lose any rigorous principle 
        of allocation. A strictly analogous outcome is evident in the segmentation 
        of the Tarot into Major and Minor Arcana. Increasingly desperate, arbitrary, 
        and mystifying attempts to re-unite the numbers and their linkages seems 
        to have bedevilled all succeeding occult traditions. <br>
        </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. <i>Numogram 
        and I Ching</i>. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is considerable 
        evidence, both immanent and historical, that the chinese I Ching and the 
        Nma numogram share a hypercultural matrix. Both are associated with intricate 
        zygonomies, or double-numbering systems, and process abstract problematics 
        involving subdivisions of decimal arrays (as suggested by the Ten Wings 
        of traditional I Ching commentary). Digital reduction of binary powers 
        stabilizes in a six-step cycle (with the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5). These 
        steps correspond to the lines of the hexagram, and to the time-circuit 
        zones of the Numogram, producing a binodecimal 6-Cycle (which is also 
        <br>
        generated in reverse by quintuplicative numbering). In both cases a supplementary 
        rule of pairing is followed, according to a zygonovic criterion (9-twinning 
        of reduced values: 8:1, 7:2, 5:4, mapping the hexagram line pairs).</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The numogram time-circuit, 
        or I Ching hexagam, implictly associates zero with the set of excluded 
        triadic values. It is intriguing in this respect that numerous indications 
        point to an early struggle between triadic and binary numbering practices 
        in ancient chinese culture, suggesting that the binary domination of decimal 
        numeracy systematically produces a triadic residue consistent with nullity. 
        The hexagram itself exhibits obvious tension in this respect, since it 
        reinserts a triadic hyperfactor into the reduced binodigital set (compounded 
        by its summation to twenty-seven, or the third power of three).</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An ancient binotriadic 
        parallel to the I Ching, called the T'ai Hsuan Ching (or Book of the Great 
        Dark) consisted of eighty-one tetragrams, reversing the relation of foregrounded 
        and implicit numerical values. The division of Lao Tse's Tao Te Ching 
        into eighty-one sections suggests that this numerical conflict was an 
        animating factor in the early history of Taoism. <br>
        <br>
        3. <i>Ethnography of the Nma</i>.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nma culture cannot 
        be decoded without the key provided by the Lemurian Time-Maze. The influence 
        of a hyper triadic criterion of time is evident in the relics of Nma kinship 
        organization, calendrics, and associated rituals. Prior to the calamity 
        of 1883, the Nma consisted of true tribes (tripartite macrosocial divisions). 
        They were distributed in a basic tridentity (interlocking large-scale 
        groupings into Tak- Mu- and Dib-Nma), supported by a triangular patrilocal 
        marriage-cycle. Each marriage identified a woman with a numogram current, 
        or time-passage. (Tak-Nma women marrying into the Mu-Nma, Mu-Nma ditto 
        Dib-Nma, Dib-Nma ditto Tak-Nma). The common calendar of all three tribes 
        was based upon a zygotriadic system (using 6 digits to divide a double-year 
        period of 729 days into fractional powers of three). The Mu-Nma still 
        employ such a calendar today. (The current Mu-Nma calendar is adjusted 
        by regular intercalations of three additional days every second cycle, 
        or four years. The earlier practice of intercalations is not easily recoverable). 
        </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the rituals 
        of the Nma the time-circuit is concretized as a hydro-cycle: a division 
        and recombination of the waters. The three stages of this recurrent transmutation 
        are, 1) the undivided waters (oceanic), 2) cloud-building (evaporation), 
        and 3) down-pour (precipitation, river-flow). These are associated with 
        the great sea-beast (Mur Mur), the lurker of steaming swamps (Oddubb), 
        and that which hunts amongst the raging storms (Katak). The cycle is closed 
        by a return to the abysmal waters, intrinsically linking the order of 
        time, and its recurrence, to an ultimate cataclysm (prior to any opposition 
        of cyclic and apocalyptic time). It is in this context that the transcultural 
        deluge-mythos can be restored to its aboriginal sense (which also corresponds 
        to the Hindu Trimurti, with its three stages of creation, preservation 
        and destruction). </font> </b> </p>
