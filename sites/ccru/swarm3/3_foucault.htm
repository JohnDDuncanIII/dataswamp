              around quarter past one on the afternoon of the 25th of June 1984 
              Michel Foucault died of an AIDS related illness. In accordance with 
              statutory requirements, the time, place and cause of his death were 
              officially certificated. Whilst Foucault's legal status may have 
              switched neatly and instantaneously from living to deceased, the 
              material of Foucault's body was not so compliant. As the cardiograph 
              displayed the steady flat line of death, a host of alternative connections 
              detected variously abating and burgeoning activity. Whilst Michel 
              Foucault, the legal entity with the capacity to enter into contractual 
              agreements abruptly ceased, his flesh, his estate, his ideas and 
              his disease, liberated from ownership, continued to operate within 
              the distributed machineries of autonomous economies. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              <p><font size="2">Arterial pressure collapses as soon as the heart 
                stops beating, the still warm blood is suddenly able to explore 
                new routes and manoeuvres. Inspired by gravity, blood drains quickly 
                from the larger veins and settles in the lowermost parts of the 
                body where it stains the flesh a purple-red colour. Primary flaccidity 
                is shortly followed by rigor mortis. The skin that reclines over 
                protruding bones is fixed within hours by the stiffening of muscles 
                that starts around the eyes and neck before spreading throughout 
                the entire body. Somewhere between two and four days later, depending 
                on prevailing weather conditions, secondary flaccidity shatters 
                the fabled still peace of death. As the body putrefies, turning 
                first green then purple then black, intestinal bacteria merge 
                more closely with their host in the massive production of rancid 
                gases which expand along veins and arteries bloating and rupturing 
                tissues and organs. Yards of tightly wound intestines distend 
                along routes of least resistance, often escaping through the vagina 
                or rectum. Whilst the human body displays immense enthusiasm in 
                its own decay, for as long as a year or so, organs continue to 
                decompose and liquefy at varying rates.</font></font> </center></font></font></div></td>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Death is not the 
        discrete event suggested by its certification or cardiographic record. 
        The cells, tissues and resident parasites which constitute a body do not 
        compliantly turn off at the appointed time. Skin, bone and muscle cells 
        can continue to live for several days after their host's heart has stopped 
        beating. Bacteria that normally inhabit the colon continue to live not 
        only in spite of their host's death, but because of it. Whereas once they 
        contributed greatly to the digestion of food, they now contribute with 
        equal devotion to the decomposition of their colonic homes. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Death is therefore 
        multiple, and dispersed in time: it is not that absolute, privileged point 
        at which time stops and moves back; like disease itself, it has a teeming 
        presence that analysis may divide into time and space; gradually, here 
        and there, each of the knots breaks until organic life ceases, at least 
        in its major forms, since long after the death of the individual, minuscule, 
        partial deaths continue to dissociate the islets of life that still subsist.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whilst there are 
        no dead ends, there are restrictions, inflexions, and critical points 
        of bifurcation. Although the visceral disturbances of both life and death 
        share similar micro-organic machinery and as such project innumerable 
        lines of continuity across the supposed life/death threshold, the interaction 
        of microbes both with each other and with larger organisms and ecologies 
        do suffer breakages and radical points of departure. Long after Foucault 
        was declared dead, his body continued to teem with life. However, as the 
        micro-organisms that inhabited that space before the 25th of July tried 
        to adapt to their dramatically changed circumstances, new life and other 
        opportunistic invaders began to stake their economic claims on Foucault's 
        carcass. Beyond some critical point, the economic advantages of incorporation 
        fell behind the potential profits of a dramatic demerger. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The human body is 
        a site of extraordinary specialization. Whilst certain cells contribute 
        to the provision of sophisticated transportation, communication or security 
        systems, others, relieved of the necessity to search out nutrition or 
        defend themselves, are able to perform specific localized functions within, 
        for example, the skin, the heart or the brain. The human complex is determined 
        and maintained by exactly replicated genetic information contained within 
        the millions of cells which collectively constitute the body. Whilst the 
        total genetic information in each cell is identical, only a tiny proportion 
        of that information is ever used by any one cell. The specific functional 
        effect of the genetic information within each cell is dependent on the 
        position of that cell relative to neighbouring cells. Due to their economic 
        specialization, multi-cellular organisms can cope easily with the odd 
        malfunctioning cell. If for example an individual cell within the kidney 
        develops more like an ear cell, due perhaps to some incorrectly reproduced 
        genetic software, then the incongruous positioning of such an alien cell 
        will normally be detected by the network of cells adjoining it. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Towards the end of 
        his life, Foucault's body became an increasingly intricate ecology with 
        the relationships between cellular guests, hosts and viral intermediaries 
        delicately balanced. With an immune system diverted into the production 
        of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the functional advantages of maintaining 
        the acutely specialized cellular structures associated with humanity became 
        increasingly tenuous. Like huge industrial corporations that have become 
        ridden with bureaucratic entropy and dissonant management styles, biological 
        structures that have ceased to function effectively as unitary organisms 
        can disintegrate into smaller, more efficient centres of production. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The human body, like 
        any economy, is of course not a closed system. Whilst its genetic makeup 
        might provide an impetus, constant interaction with other systems around 
        it and within it perpetually challenge and mediate the body's boundaries. 
        Just as each cell forms relative to its neighbouring cells, so each body 
        is continually reconstructed in relation to its environment. The development 
        of particular muscle groups, the accumulation of plates of hardened skin 
        or the curvature of the spine are affected by terrain, climate, habitat 
        and occupation. Streams of carbohydrates, water, bacteria, oxygen, proteins 
        and information are constantly trapped, bound and diverted through the 
        networks of veins, ducts and neurons. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In addition to environmental 
        factors that are chemically absorbed directly into its genetic structure, 
        the human body regularly encounters microbes which variously nestle within 
        its complex folds. Without becoming part of its innate genetic structure, 
        viruses, bacteria and other parasites successively enter into a number 
        of interesting arrangements within the human body. On some occasions parasites 
        are detected by the immune system and immediately destroyed whilst on 
        other occasions a more elongated battle occurs during which symptomatic 
        disease may result in the host. Interlopers are sometimes permanently 
        accommodated within the body's elaborate structures -occasionally the 
        presence of aliens is merely tolerated, at other times the introduction 
        of additional genetic information can be advantageous and is positively 
        welcomed. Viruses, in particular, achieve such a close relationship to 
        their host that drawing a distinction between host and guest becomes impossible. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A virus is little 
        more than a wandering capsule of genetic code. Unlike bacterial parasites 
        that can replicate, given the right nutrients, outside a host, viruses 
        can only replicate through entering into a symbiotic relationship with 
        a host cell. Viruses are extremely efficient pieces of machinery that 
        are structurally pared down to a minimum. The genetic information stored 
        in strings of either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
        refers only to those vital functions that cannot be performed by a host 
        cell. Like specialized pieces of software floating on the net, each virus 
        contains the critical information necessary to perform a specific routine. 
        In order to activate the virus's self replicating program, the necessary 
        genetic instructions must to be imported into the appropriate hardware 
        and accompanying operating system. Once the virus, or at least its packaged 
        genetic code, has physically entered a suitable host cell, the genetic 
        software can effectively be unzipped and subsequently installed into the 
        cell's existing operating system. Different viruses interact with their 
        hosts in various ways, ultimately however, they must all achieve a similar 
        programming feat. Viruses must effectively reprogram the host cell's own 
        replicating machinery and utilize its resources in order to reproduce. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the case of HIV, 
        the appropriate hardware can be provided by CD4 T-cells. CD4 T-cells are 
        crucial to the human immune system in that they play a dual role in the 
        recognition and eradication of both intracellular and extracellular invaders. 
        Through reprogramming one of the human body's chief security agents, HIV 
        performs an incredible pincer movement. Not only is the virus provided 
        with cells willing to become HIV replication factories, but through corrupting 
        key elements of the body's immune system, HIV simultaneously reduces the 
        possibility of detection. HIV appears to be strategically astute, after 
        initial infection, the virus often maintains a low profile for many years 
        during which time, it gradually infiltrates its host immune system and 
        optimizes replication potential through exploiting routes into other host 
        bodies. The full implication of HIV's painstaking work only becomes fully 
        apparent when, at some point in the future, a third party opportunistically 
        utilizes and develops the work already completed. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The body of Michel 
        Foucault, which earlier appeared to have such distinct insides and outsides, 
        blurs in both directions. HIV, having entered into partnership with the 
        CD4 T-cells which were formerly in alliance with his body's immune system, 
        systematically changed his genetic make-up. The new function of these 
        cells became the reproduction of HIV. Similarly Foucault surreptitiously 
        entered and infected some of the crucial structures of his environment. 
        Unlike other more obvious foe that broadcast their malicious intent as 
        they embark on full frontal attack, Foucault negotiated his way into centres 
        of production through forming pragmatic relationships in culturally sensitive 
        zones. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Consider, for example, 
        the discursive structures that produce the author. Prior to infection 
        they produced a broadly linear model of authority where the ideas contained 
        in a text, for instance, were the unproblematic product of a particular 
        person. Foucault's interaction did not cease the production of authors, 
        but fundamentally changed the discursive programming through which they 
        were understood. By reconstructing the author as a discursive product 
        itself, the Foucauldian infection did not destroy the text production 
        machinery, but instead repositioned the author as a function of that machinery. 
        Obviously, Foucault should not be thought of here as the author of this 
        change, but merely as one factor amongst many which in combination proved 
        sufficient to effect a change. Similarly it is far from clear quite what 
        role HIV has in producing the syndrome of various diseases referred to 
        collectively as AIDS. Peter Duesburg maintains that no relationship exists, 
        others argue for a linear cause and effect model. Given the weight of 
        evidence pointing at some level of connectivity, it seems likely that 
        HIV is in some way complexly related to the array of symptomatic conditions 
        that become diagnosed as AIDS. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During the second 
        half of the 1940s, Foucault spent two or three years at Sainte-Anne, a 
        major psychiatric hospital in central Paris. Foucault's accounts of the 
        period of his life are, according to David Macey, 'fairly vague, if not 
        actually misleading, and are the products of either hazy memory or a reluctance 
        to supply the information that would allow his identity at any given moment 
        to be established with too great a precision'<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>..."nobody 
        worried about what I should be doing; I was free to do anything. I was 
        actually in a position between the staff and the patients."<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
        Within the corridors, theatres, arteries and chambers of the hospital, 
        Foucault's own mental instability was free to wander. Just as Foucault's 
        body failed to fully appreciate the lethal potential of HIV, so the psychiatrists 
        of Saint-Anne failed to recognize the potential danger Foucault posed 
        to their authority. Integrated with its CD4 T-cell host, HIV occupies 
        a truly ambivalent position, neither host nor guest, this symbiotic alien 
        passes as a member of a distributed security system. Similarly Foucault, 
        dressed in a white coat, was neither staff nor patient, but enjoying his 
        ambiguous status, he was sufficiently able to pass as an authority figure.

        that shields the nucleic-acid core of a virus is constructed of successive 
        chains of amino-acid that geometrically lock together like ornate building 
        blocks. It is the intricate shape of the virus's outer shell that facilitates 
        it's initial attachment to a potential host cell. Although viruses are 
        often cell-specific, that is to say that they can only attach and integrate 
        successfully with one particular type of cell, they have no means for 
        actively searching out potential hosts. HIV, for example, can only attach 
        to the CD4 protein which is present on just two types of blood cell. The 
        HIV virus does not exhibit intent, it does not have a pre-existing plan 
        of attack, instead it must rely on chance encounter. On being asked by 
        colleagues at Uppsala University whether he was aware of a suitable candidate 
        for the post of French assistant, Georges Dum&eacute;zil, with no personal 
        knowledge of a suitable person, happened to mention the post to his archaeologist 
        friend Raoul Curiel. By coincidence Curiel had recently met Foucault and 
        had enjoyed a conversation with him about the uncertain state of his career. 
        Curiel's enthusiasm was sufficient to encourage Dum&eacute;zil to write 
        inviting Foucault to apply for the vacant post. In taking a job at Uppsala 
        University, Foucault was not enacting an elaborate plan that would eventually 
        led to the heart of the French academe, instead his moving to Sweden in 
        August 1955 was apparently the result of pure chance. </font>

        opponents friends and other relatives of Foucault have variously endeavoured 
        to encapsulate his major themes, thrusts and intentions. Whether as pathogen,

        disease has, perhaps unsurprisingly, usually been written from a human 
        perspective. Viruses, represented as pathogenic threats to be battled 
        or better eradicated, have often been named after the bodily symptoms 
        they induce. The conflation of virus with disease is an overly simplistic 
        reduction that crucially misunderstands the mechanisms of both virus and 
        disease. Symptoms can only emerge through the combined efforts of both 
        body and virus. Beyond a host, viruses are closer to being abstractions 
        of information than abstractions of disease. It is not merely the words, 
        thoughts or actions of Foucault that produces bodily effects, it is critically 
        their interaction with the dynamic bodies of knowledge and power that 
        have symptomatic results. Unlike the polemical who merely seeks to replace 
        one orthodoxy with another, the irritant problematizes both. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As evidenced by newly 
        emergent diseases, the modern development of vaccines designed to obstruct 
        specific viruses failed to anticipate their evolutionary potential. In 
        privileging genotypes over phenotypes, the rationale behind programmes 
        of mass vaccination overestimated the precision of viral replication and 
        hence underestimated the ability of viruses to deal with changed circumstances. 
        Evidence amassed through trying to combat HIV has revealed threat massive 
        levels of replication combined with regular mutation allowed new strains 
        of virus to find routes around therapeutic obstacles. In the leather bars 
        of San Franscisco, Foucault discovered similar mechanisms at play. Amongst 
        the throng of sex, drugs and men, new routes to pleasure emerged through 
        the fluid economies of power and identity. Within a context of moral, 
        religious and legal restriction, the repetition and mutation encompassed 
        by promiscuous sadomasochistic activities operate, beyond the necessary 
        intentions of practitioners, to investigate the boundaries of prohibition.

        and slave, and at the end the slave has become the master. Or, even when 
        the roles are stabilized, you know very well that it is always a game:

        sexual practices has anything to do with the disclosure or the understanding 
        of S/M tendencies deep within our unconscious...I think that S/M is much

        and slave, pleasure and pain, yearning and disgust, and sickness and health, 
        do not operate to reveal an essential identity, but actively synthesize 
        new identities. Ridden with contradictions, discontinuities and strange 
        connectivities, the temporary self that emerges through S/M does not merely 
        provide an alternative to a properly constituted self, but through feeding 
        back into the productive machinery of identity, it problematizes the very

        free to mingle and combine, exchanging information and bodily fluids. 
        Within the opportunistic economies of the dark room and the human body, 
        where complex pathways are casually explored, there are no overarching 
        schemata, no predetermined projects and no ordained truth. Foucault's 
        body, although never a closed system, was enticed, by viruses, fists and 
        other unanticipated connectivities, along the dangerous path that hugs 
        the edge of bodily organization. Born into a genetic straitjacket, the

        that these games with oneself would better be left backstage; or, at best, 
        that they might properly form part of those preliminary exercises that 
        are forgotten once they have served their purpose. But, then, what is 
        philosophy today - philosophical activity, I mean - if it is not the critical 
        work that thought brings to bear on itself? In what does it consist, if

        material exercises in the exploration of bodily boundaries. Whether they 
        happen to be bodies of power/knowledge, bodies of organizations or organisms, 
        bodies of cells or bodies of flesh, it is the limits and edges of bodies 
        that distinguish the zones of learning. It is the act of pushing a little 
        further, peering round dark corners and searching out the invisible that 
        produces the new thoughts to which Foucault refers. Learning is not a 
        conscious process, it does not happen as a direct result of effort, rather 
        it is the apparent accident, the so-called mistake, the strange coincidence 
        of circumstance that produce unexpected effects and syntheses. </font>

        are not designed by some omnipotent force to render vaccinations obsolete, 
        viruses do not try to evolve with a particular aim in mind, on the contrary, 
        in accordance with their genetic code they endeavour to replicate as accurately 
        as possible. Sometimes poor raw materials or restricted physical circumstances 
        can result in a "mistake", instead of producing an exact replication of 
        itself, the virus produces a mutation. Usually these malformed replicants 
        perish quickly, unable to compete with their perfectly formed kin. Occasionally, 
        however, in specific circumstances and at a particular time, a mutation 
        may occur that is better suited to its environment and is therefore more 
        likely to survive and replicate. In a vaccinated body, for example, a 
        virus whose outer shell has undergone some form of mutation, is less likely 
        to be recognized by that body's immune system and is therefore more likely 
        to be able to enter into successful partnership with suitable host cells. 
        Viral learning is neither a matter of design nor simply a matter of chance, 
        instead viral learning is a complex function of constraint and opportunity.

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Amongst the complexly 
        interconnected neurons of Foucault's brain, billions of negotiated boundaries 
        learnt in response to information flowing through and around his body. 
        Although hailed as one of the great thinkers of the twentieth century, 
        a slice extracted from Foucault's brain would look disappointingly much 
        the same as a slice taken from any other brain. The most powerful microscopes 
        would reveal no secrets, no insights and no thoughts. Had it been possible 
        to tag and follow a momentary sensation into the philosopher's cortex, 
        it would not have divulged an eventual resting place, rather it would 
        have been seen to split and dissipate around various neural networks. 
        A particular sensation or moment is not so much stored by the brain as 
        absorbed by it. Oblivious to any discursively constructed meaning, parallel 
        networks of nerve cells are continuously and minutely tuned as electrical 
        excitations speed across them. In response to appropriate stimuli, memories 
        are literally re-membered as various configurations of neurons are jolted 
        into action. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In a short story 
        entitled The Secrets of a Man, Herv&eacute; Guibert describes the fascination 
        of a neurosurgeon as he dissects the brain of a famous philosopher, although 
        the philosopher's name is never mentioned, it is clear that Foucault was 
        the inspiration behind Guibert's work. As the surgeon digs deeper he slowly 
        reveals visceral traces of the memories, ideas and passions of his subject. 
        During the final weeks of his life, Foucault spent a considerable amount 
        of time in conversation with Guibert. Unknown to Foucault, Guibert not 
        only carefully recorded their conversations, but also transcribed the 
        details of Foucault's delirium, his moods, attitudes and appearance. As 
        the fictional neurosurgeon scrutinizes the philosopher's brain, he discovers 
        three particularly deeply ingrained memories. The first of these "terrible 
        dioramas" tells of a young boy who is forced to witness an amputation 
        performed by his father. The second describes a courtyard still permeated 
        with the presence of a woman imprisoned there for decades. The third tells 
        of an able student whose locally celebrated position is threatened by 
        a sudden influx of talented intruders, it recalls how the child philosopher's 
        wish to be rid of the unwelcome competition is granted by the Nazi extermination 
        of the Jewish refugees. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In an interview on 
        French television in 1990 Guibert was accused of intruding on Foucault's 
        private agonies and exploiting them for his own selfish motives. Guibert 
        attempted to defend himself, but admitted that he thought Foucault would 
        have been furious had he known of the secret journal. By 1984 Foucault's 
        body was well accustomed to uninvited intruders, any fury directed at 
        Guibert should have been reserved for a far less intelligent crime. The 
        cerebral layers that are painstakingly revealed by Guibert's neurosurgeon 
        owe nothing to the tangible neurological organization of Foucault's brain. 
        Through his deployment of a metaphorical archaeology, Guibert not only 
        drags Foucault's carcass back to the 1960s, but denies his brain it's 
        dynamic complexity. In 1971, Foucault contributed an essay entitled Nietzsche, 
        La G&eacute;ne&aacute;logie, l'histoire to a collection of works published 
        in tribute to his mentor Jean Hyppolite. In this essay Foucault recognizes 
        the inherrent failings of an archeological analytics and proposes that 
        Nietzschean genealogy presents a more interesting route of investigation.

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Drawing from Guibert's 
        accounts of his final conversations with Foucault, James Miller claims, 
        'The "obligation of truth," it seems, really was Foucault's unavoidable 
        fate - just as he implied in his final lectures at the Coll&egrave;ge 
        de France. Try as he might, the philosopher could not remain silent about 
        who he really was.'<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> It is, of course, far 
        from impossible that Foucault may have eventually surrendered to the urge 
        to confess, he was, after all, intimately aware of the pervasive machinery 
        through which this impulse is propagated. However, to equate the act of 
        confession with the truth of the man owes more to the words of the Pope 
        than to the words of Foucault. Although his work may have produced remarkable 
        insights into the economies of discourse, it should not be assumed that 
        his critique necessarily insulated his body from the effects of discourse 
        or any other economies. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The episodes of his 
        life that Foucault shared with Guibert can no more be equated with the 
        "terrible dioramas" poetically discovered by the scalpel of an imaginary 
        surgeon than can HIV be equated with the truth of his sexual desires. 
        Encounters with amputation, incarceration and HIV undoubtedly influence 
        the body, they induce reactions and inspire chemical adjustments. Their 
        effects, however, are not laid down like slate on a riverbed, instead 
        they are absorbed and dissipated around complex networks. Whilst Guibert 
        may have been in no position to draw linear equations of cause and effect 
        between distant moments in Foucault's life, the same must also be said 
        of Foucault himself. The validity of archaeological activity is not enhanced 
        by the authority of the archaeologist in charge of the dig. The process 
        of excavation does not uncover fundamental truths, but discursively attaches 
        historical significance to momentary abstractions. As Foucault's body 
        lay on the pathologist's slab, expert observations revealed strange lesions 
        chased across its cerebral cortex, although these scars encapsulated no 
        "terrible dioramas", they were evidence of extraordinary neural activity. 
        Whilst Guibert was engaged in composing his secret notes and constructing 
        truths from Foucault's musings, microscopic neurosurgeons were busy investigating 
        the neural pathways that twist around the crevices of a philosopher's 
        brain. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Toxoplasma gondii 
        is a protozoan parasite that resides relatively innocently in approximately 
        half of the world's human population. 50% to 60% of the inhabitants of 
        the United States are believed to be infected, in the United Kingdom the 
        figure is between 20% and 40% and in France it is estimated that up to 
        90% of the population play host to the tiny organism. In spite of pandemic 
        distribution, its symptomatic manifestation known as toxoplasmosis is 
        extremely rare. According to most medical texts , the only statistically 
        notable consequence had seemed to be amongst foetuses whose mothers became 
        newly infected during pregnancy. During the early 1980s, however toxoplasmosis, 
        alongside Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, was one 
        of the extraordinarily rare diseases which suddenly started to emerge 
        amongst the concentrated gay populations of New York and California. Drawing 
        from evidence of toxoplasmosis amongst organ transplant patients whose 
        immune systems are actively compromised to avoid rejection, it appears 
        that the "normal" asymptomatic accommodation of Toxoplasma gondii is transformed 
        by immunosuppression. Given its corrupting effect on T4 cells, HIV does 
        present a logical accomplice for Toxoplasma gondii's more adventurous 
        ambitions. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The full life cycle 
        of Toxoplasma gondii can only be sexually completed in either wild or 
        domestic cats. Following the fusion of macro and micro gametes the resultant 
        oocysts eventually pass to intermediate hosts via the cat's faeces. Any 
        warm blooded animal including man can act as an intermediate host. Following 
        the ingestion of fertilized cysts, digestive enzymes cause the cysts to 
        rupture allowing rapidly replicating tachyzoites to be distributed throughout 
        the body by the blood and lymphatic systems. Eventually numbers of tachyzoites 
        begin to cling together and form tissue cysts commonly in the eye, skeletal 
        muscle, cardiac muscle, and frequently the brain of the secondary host. 
        These cysts usually then remain dormant within the tissues of the intermediate 
        host and are only reactivated once reintroduced to the primary host through 
        its eating infected flesh. Evidence suggests that the dormant phase of 
        the life cycle is ensured by the immune system of the secondary host, 
        it appears that the Toxoplasma gondii protozoa find themselves unavoidably 
        detained. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whilst Guibert studiously 
        analyzed the surface effects that rippled across Foucault's body, he was 
        unaware of the tangled economies that collectively contributed to each 
        twitch and every word. Alongside the cerebral structures of most of his 
        compatriots, Michel Foucault's brain, had operated as an effective prison 
        for Toxoplasma gondii. Prior to its relationship with HIV, his immune 
        system kept a careful watch over the sleeping cysts. By June 1984, however, 
        his depleted immune system had all but lost the multiple battles it was 
        having with a number of opportunistic invaders. The encysted Toxoplasma 
        gondii protozoa seized an unexpected opportunity for further replication. 
        With insiders' information, the intracellular parasites explored for further 
        possibilities within Foucault's brain. Oblivious to potential meanings 
        discursively mapped onto a distant surface, each parasitic organism minutely 
        analysed the material of Foucault's mind. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1757, Damiens 
        the regicide was sentenced to death. He was to have the flesh torn from 
        his chest, arms, thighs and calves, his body was to be drawn and quartered, 
        and his limbs and trunk were to be reduced to ashes and thrown to the 
        winds. In spite of six horses and specifically manufactured steel pincers, 
        the body of Damiens displayed considerable endurance. The tissues of his 
        thighs and torso clung to their bones with irritating resilience, his 
        arms and legs defeated the efforts of a team of horses and relinquished 
        their bodily attachment only after much of the connecting sinews and muscles 
        had been hacked away. The body of Damiens, through its elongated decomposition, 
        asserted a persistent unity. Faced with many battles at multiple sites, 
        the body, far from disintegrating into composite parts, demonstrates its 
        obstinate, if short lived, integrity. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1984, the body 
        of Foucault was engaged in numerous struggles on various divergent fronts. 
        Whilst his last two books jostled with other publications for room in 
        bookshops, for critical evaluation and for their appropriate position 
        within a body of work, inherited and latterly acquired genetic information 
        competed for the control of blood cells, and neurons fought with parasites 
        for the space to think. Whilst oxygen and mucus battled for time with 
        his lungs and pain killers grappled with neuro-transmitters, moralists 
        defined the cause of his body's disease and his friends deduced the secrets 
        of his soul. Like the body of Damiens, the body of Foucault is not eradicated 
        by the multitudinous machineries that constantly challenge the boundaries 
        of its existence. Quite the reverse, the body of Foucault is constantly 
        reconstructed through the complex interplay of these technologies of the 
        body. </font>
      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>...this technology 
        is diffuse, rarely formulated in continuous, systematic discourse; it 
        is often made up of bits and pieces; it implements a disparate set of 
        tools and methods. In spite of the coherence of its results, it is generally 
        no more than a multiform instrumentation...the power exercised on the 
        body is conceived not as a property, but as a strategy, that its effects 
        of domination are attributed not to 'appropriation', but to dispositions, 
        manoeuvres, tactics, techniques, functionings; that one should decipher 
        in it a network of relations, constantly in tension, in activity, rather 
        than a privilege that one might possess; that one should take as its model 
        a perpetual battle rather than a contract regulating a transaction or 
        the conquest of a territory.</i><a href="#"><sup>11</sup></a> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The diffused mechanisms 
        immanent to Foucault's body were neither its property nor devoted solely 
        to its service. Each HIV virus, whilst circulating through Foucault's 
        veins, were also intimately engaged elsewhere. As each virus contributed 
        their micro-effects to the 'dying body', they were simultaneously woven 
        into the fabric of a pandemic disease. Working in symbiotic combination 
        with blood cells, medical orthodoxy, academic propriety and bacterial 
        infection, the virus manoeuvred into new positions and accommodations 
        dragging in its wake the fluid parameters of Foucault and other bodies. 
        For 57 years, a network of relations were held in sufficient tension to 
        produce an overall effect of a coherent body, a persistent identity and 
        an authoritative mind. The body of Foucault as a discursive locus may 
        have dissipated, but the millions of traces left after this local decomposition 
        continue to circulate and replicate through related and disconnected bodies. 
        The organic death of this author enacts the discursive death of the author. 
        By leaving his "work" obviously unfinished and by removing the corporeal 
        remnants of the "author", the viral machinery once associated with Foucault 
        is now able to replicate at speed, producing thousands of mutations and 
        adapting to changed circumstances. </font>
