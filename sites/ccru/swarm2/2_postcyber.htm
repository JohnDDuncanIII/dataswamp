   <tr align="justify" valign="top">
    <td align="justify" height="100%" width="100%"> 
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="2">Magic-emperors 
      appear; they are lit from behind, they are circled in an arc, organised 
      around carousel decoration, English art-deco figureheads, which are filled 
      in with the representations of detailed botanical paintings, the use of 
      myth, Buddhist-Kings. Such Binder-Gods, chime pleasantly when they are lit, 
      they can see you, being covenant enhanced and resounding;- for example, 
      Loci and his lamp, Radha with her dance, Arthurian legend, the one-eyed 
      monster directing from a clearing, the animals gathered kiss the ground 
      and become grass. The arc is woven with symbol and refrain, vulgar music, 
      the clatter of mechanism as its appeal is telegraphed, transformed and transmitted. 
      The half-circled regalia of the stance, pictures an horrific progression. 
      You must play the game. The figures are lit from the back; they shine, it 
      is hard to escape their gaze. 
      <p> Below the magic-emperors are the more complex regimes of pattern and 
        belief. They take hold of the players, not rapt with the power of the 
        look. They are never fully lit up, they never totally confront you with 
        your fear; but define pathways and webs of connection that lead onto different 
        levels. There are a complicated mass of socio-historic signs and signifiers; 
        entirely jumbled into abstract symbolism and logical distinction. Planes 
        of colour, diagonal and axial crosses, digital codes, heraldry, stars, 
        pentangles, circles and squares. This confusion of relative power relations, 
        manifest themselves as the legitimised ornaments of government;- Chamfort, 
        Goerring, Lord Palmerston, Henry Kissenger. These are the manipulators 
        of the knot; they appear on the letterhead, they take bites out of logos, 
        they make feasts with one-arm bandits; they laugh, as the coins fall from 
        the sky. 
      <p> Fully encased in metal, another ball bearing fires. It flies into the 
        chaos of combat; war, mutilated body parts, triggered islands of information. 
        The mechanical noises accumulate your score, it roams over centuries, 
        half-buried; then surfaces at an instance of opposition, silence, and 
        revenge. It is a genetic algorithm of detailed psychosis, which is written 
        by a shuffling, anonymous attendant. You are placed on the operating table, 
        he implants you with your score, you are ready to continue, able to make 
        another play. The ball passes through the gap, the violence is evacuated; 
        the Gods lit up, the symbols and signs direct the process to the next 
        phase. 
      <p> Here money and their markets, the individual and game theory, all exist 
        in various states of equilibrium. No longer playing, but being played, 
        no longer spending, but being spent; the thresholds are subtle, the diversions 
        extreme, unrelenting. Competitive equilibrium is nonpersonal. The theory 
        of the core dictates markets which depend on individual actions. Core 
        analysis is the determination of a set of possible outcomes, these outcomes 
        are compatible with their dealers; competition is not regulated from the 
        outside. Price stability must be actively pursued if it is to effect the 
        market. Dealers and traders participate in this regulation themselves; 
        money is assumed, value is transitive, fluid; metal poured through open 
        chutes. Core theory solves problems involving increased returns, indivisibilities, 
        lump funded projects. The collision of active interest capacity forces 
        imputations into the core; the markets are traced within closer and tighter 
        circuits. Trading tackles new limits of multi-unitary dimension, relations 
        between traders and dealers are here complex convex-works; such convexity 
        has the implication of sealing off the relations between markets into 
        sets which satisfy core constraints. Nonempty cores are therefore necessary 
        to address game models of market forces. Common unit values have to be 
        pursued, these values are potentially pro-active, and independent. Money 
        can set up on its own. 
      <p> Information is expensive. Market participants limit their contacts depending 
        on the number of information sources which are available. Information 
        directs the speed of the market. Substitution allows the participants 
        to be involved in the market for the longest possible period. With substitution, 
        the information needed to secure contact between participants is at its 
        lowest cost. Products may then be transferred in their constituent units. 
        Trade becomes predictable. The Cournot-Nash theory supplies a framework 
        for determining the relationship between collusion and competition. Under 
        these conditions, market forces are stabilised, the predictability of 
        substituted trade transfers to legal restraint, black markets are dominated 
        and subsumed. Thus information acts in a bipodal fashion with respect 
        to trade. It encourages substitution, and it develops different strata 
        of relations; those legislated, and those beyond the law. In the net landscape 
        of information dispersal, the trade relations may be simultaneously, delegislated 
        and unsubstituted. 
      <p> The next game expands beyond the cybernetic interactions of trade. It 
        engulfs a continent, the Indian peninsula. The conflict between the superpowers, 
        has left a deep rift in the organization of society; the modern equivalent 
        of Athens and Sparta, fighting over history. The gulf between land and 
        city defines a zone of interaction, which has the potential to become 
        infected by innovation, and the organization of flows of capital. Indian 
        social structures are ready to be swept into this interaction, reorganized, 
        and re-established in different phases. Out of phase, demonic and creative, 
        the caste system defines new ways of looking at social structure. The 
        myths of the Hindu, lit up from behind, arced onto the platinum dashboard 
        of technological innovation, and combined with the patterns and signs 
        of Manu belief; together foretell a liberalised future of city life. Bangalore 
        defines this state, it is a state which Heidegger could not have conceived 
        of; it is a state which amphetamine sulphate will not take you close to. 
        Bangalore is a postmodern opiate, an offshoot from the vision of Ridley 
        Scott. The edge of war, cyberspace. 
      <p> Stanislav Andreski looks at the issue of social change in terms of biataxy. 
        Biataxy is the settlement of argument through force. No society is completely 
        devoid of biataxy. Through its placement as the backdrop for the assessment 
        of social matters; many of the false oppositions in society may be removed. 
        War is not opposite to peace, love has nothing to do with hate. All are 
        forces, any expression presupposes the setting of biataxy; Gandhi and 
        Nehru, with the formal expression of peace, were defining a methodology 
        for dealing with imminent thermo-nuclear attack. The UN, with its global 
        crusade to maintain the status quo, are preparing us for cyberspace. War 
        on the internet is immanent; it has no precursors, it has no goals, it 
        will not cause any territories to fall, other than its own. This collapse 
        is the integration of technology with biology. The fusion of metal and 
        flesh, the intensity of the flame with the atom. 
      <p> Deleuze and Guattari explore these factors through an examination of 
        isomorphy. Capital can be mobilised to render projects such as communication 
        with extra-terrestrials as operative; thus flows of money open up the 
        edge for further territorial gains. This is axiomatic to the extent that 
        decoded flows may be thought of in terms of immanent models of realisation. 
        Such isomorphy, accommodates itself to the greatest of formal differences, 
        encompassing polymorphic models, and political "problems" in the organization 
        of a State. In the climate of information technology, the axiomatic and 
        models of realisation, are continually crossing over each in communication. 
        Social subjectification proportions itself to the model of realisation, 
        machinic enslavement expands to meet the dimensions of the axiomatic that 
        are effectuated in the model. In the example of television, the viewer 
        is enslaved as a human machine insofar as they are no longer consumers 
        or users or subjects; but are intrinsic component parts, input and output, 
        feedback; recurrences which are no longer connected to the machine in 
        such a way as to produce it. 
      <p> In the orientation of game theory, strategies vary from zero-sum to 
        non-zero-sum. Social choices are viewed as being on a continuum, from 
        pure co-ordination through mixed motive to pure conflict games. Since 
        most social choices can be effected only if coalitions are formed, the 
        processes of coalition formation must be theorised if the mechanisms of 
        social choice are to be understood. A minimum resource theory will emphasise 
        the initial resources to effect a decision which the players bring to 
        the situation, rather than their strategic bargaining position. The minimum 
        power theory acts in a similar way to the minimum resource theory, making 
        use of coefficients to state that participants will demand a share of 
        the payoff proportional to their pivotal power. The pivotal power hypothesis 
        defines the power of the winning coalition; anticompetitive hypotheses 
        are useful to define the cohesion of social groups, but tend to materialise 
        norms by which social behaviour may be placed against. Utter confusion 
        theory, where political coalitions emerge from complete bedlam, is best 
        theorised by the use of random choice process, where coincidence may be 
        written into the machinic operation of the formula. 
      <p> India's main adversary has been Pakistan. The development of its nuclear 
        capacity has been a closely debated race between the two nations. Domestic 
        nuclear power, the threat of attack from the superpowers and China, have 
        added impetus to the necessity for splitting the atom. Both now possess 
        the ability to launch nuclear attack. The climate of suspicion has given 
        way to the unease of nuclear stalemate. Economic development in India 
        will encourage the expansion of foreign policy; yet the capital required 
        to shift the core zones of Tokyo, Singapore or Hong Kong to Bangalore, 
        will only be achieved via the acceleration inherent within information 
        dispersal. The substantial Indian meshwork was written into the post-British 
        Indian withdrawal; it was a product of the conflict between neighbours 
        in the socio-economic region and the restructured relationship between 
        village and town. The antimarket is in place to the extent that the non-competitive 
        elements have been set into society by the codes of religion; the self 
        organization of the rural, and the abundant entrepreneurial expertise. 
        The last component necessary for the development of microeconomic relationship 
        reversals is the internet or (directed information), the reality of information 
        dispersal. Asia as the producer, Europe as the market. The feedback processes 
        shall increase up until a biurfication point, at which the socio-economic 
        flows shall be considered to be invariant. Asia will then be the core, 
        Europe and America will turn around it; feeding off the dual axioms of 
        violence and leisure. 
      <p> Religion has played a pivotal role in the regulation of violence between 
        city and the Land. The rule of the priests, not being centrally governed 
        has dictated the sedimentation of social spheres into their component 
        parts. This has been called stratification. Yet as real time is subsumed 
        beneath economic acceleration, the sediment will be dissolved, they will 
        go to make a figure such as:- becoming lava. This precipitates the reorganization 
        of Indian society on the grounds of economic microunits; through bypassing 
        governmental regulation, and with the biataxic conditions of polarity, 
        relativatised into webworks of information loss and retrieval. The product 
        assimilation of peasant aggregates, is not Marxian in the establishment 
        of harmonised power structures, dealing fluidly with control mechanisms; 
        convergent points becoming pivotal in the matrix. It will instead lead 
        to the war zone being translated onto the net. Harmonisation is not a 
        factor in the determination of the redistribution of wealth. The cyclic 
        process of product level versus dispersal rate, defines the way in which 
        global wealth shall be rationalised into noticeable reversals of international 
        economic market forces. 
      <p> This has also been looked at in terms of saturation. It could be falsely 
        claimed that the saturation of a system marks its point of inversion. 
        Yet saturation itself is relative. The axiomatisation of capital flows 
        defines an immanent system of laws. This system continually confronts 
        its own laws as the motor for market renewal. In the nuclear industry, 
        the laws which are continually confronted, are the laws of energy dispersal, 
        which are tending to become gridded, in ever increasing complex networks, 
        depending on the available saturation points within the system. These 
        points are the focal markers of grid complexification; known as attractors 
        of phase movement, and the stage directions for social change. In terms 
        of electronic media, the saturation points are the convergent elements 
        of socio-economic organization. They are the profit centres of information 
        and distributed, molecular models of realisation. 
      <p> The continual adjustment of the axioms of market forces, results in 
        struggles for the enunciation of principle and the tension in the State. 
        Large corporations, State benefactors, military pressure groups; are the 
        liquidating factors in the rural field of immanence. There is a fundamental 
        difference between the living flows, and the axioms which subordinate 
        themselves to centres of control and decision making. The latter act in 
        order to produce a given geographical segment, corresponding to their 
        axioms which they then measure in quanta. Living flows do not orientate 
        themselves in a centrally locatable formation of technocratic hierarchy. 
        They are the moving parts of the relationships between status and order; 
        the cyclones and the precipitation. These base units or cells are the 
        exigent matters in the affairs of the State. BSE or the reorganization 
        of Soviet farming economies, show that the proliferance of State legislation 
        in a rural setting, makes the hierarchical relationship between city and 
        the Land fragile and brittle. If market forces are to be in phase with 
        living axioms State legislation has to be bypassed, singularities must 
        be followed, the sword has to be cast in the forge. 
      <p> States are isomorphic. They encourage the homogenisation of capital 
        in an external world market. They also promote the existence of a single 
        integrated domestic market, as is happening in Europe. The isomorphy of 
        the models of production of the State depends upon how the domestic and 
        foreign markets are distributed. This isomorphy is not homogeneous as 
        such, but collects axioms into unities or rights. These consistencies 
        are divided by capital into segments which span modes of production and 
        the political hierarchies which grow around them. The parasitical functionalism 
        of the socialist States, which has been framed as "virus-creative" is 
        the model of market realisation, which by and large has been used in the 
        Third World. The existence of a single external world market determines 
        the plane of capital which is to be extracted from the emergent State 
        organization of the parasitic and the viral. This is by no means the old 
        style relationship of dependency and gain, which hailed from the colonial 
        empires; and is particularly pertinent in the example of India. The tyranny 
        of tea and opium, has given way to a capital relationship; one which may 
        be manipulated from either end of the transfer of resource, money or skills. 
        This is a polymorphic situation, and one in which the axiomatics of India 
        will not necessarily be absorbed into core markets at the centre. 
      <p> Polymorphism constitutes beneficial conditions by which information 
        dispersal may be achieved. The net will be wrenched from the nerd-monopoly 
        which seeks to isolate certain functioning capacities in the end-game 
        strategies of accumulative choice. These paradigms are programmed by the 
        Western ideals of democracy, freedom and Enlightenment teaching. These 
        are weak and unstable, in relation to the Eastern social movements of 
        multicellular yet combined axiomatic dispersal. Japan was a beginning. 
        The forecast Pacific-Rim trading figures, are a smoke-screen. The real 
        action starts to take place when the polymorphism of the viral-creative 
        is translated into trade relations which reflect the substantial productive 
        capacities of the rhizomatic. That is, shifting circuits of energy interaction, 
        where the innovative and technological are injected into the living body 
        of axiomatic production. Products are the transitive and valueless ornaments 
        of a world trade situation, in which the benefactors are in the process 
        of becoming irrelevant. Their subsidence into the organic, is the translation 
        of a code which began in the fifteenth century. 
      <p> DNA is the last gasp of Western science. The decoding of the double 
        helix, is the model of realisation for the Enlightenment ideal of discovering 
        the secrets of nature. This fantasy has economic and social concomitant 
        effects. The economic realities of the biotechnology which has evolved 
        around the search for DNA strands has pushed the socio-scientific community 
        to new levels of integration. Yet these levels are not matched by the 
        flows of capital into the development of socio-economic conditions to 
        sustain the search at its optimal level of speed. Instead, the technology 
        is fully transferable to other locations with lower levels of production 
        cost, and more integrated communities, where ideal time direction may 
        be situated in a consistent and stable strata. With the circumvention 
        of central capital accumulation, the escape from the regulation of bureaucracy, 
        and the development of socius interaction without the necessity of defense 
        mechanisms inhibiting viral creation the communal scientific prerogative 
        of the West will be reversed. This shall be a relative reversal, corresponding 
        to capital saturation points, and the phase stages involved with social 
        movement. 
      <p> The Brahmin as nomads. Lines of flight described as East-West pivots. 
        The Aryan invaders used their metallurgic skill to innovate beyond the 
        levels of their sedentary adversaries. The laws of Manu, the myths of 
        the Hindu, are the overcoded fragments of war; implanted in a relationship 
        with the Land, needed to establish the domain between rival city states. 
        The Land watched on in bewilderment, as the warring factions proceeded 
        to destroy one another. This destruction has been arrested by the advent 
        of the nuclear age. War on the extrinsic scale is impossible. The State 
        system, left by the British, consolidated by the Gandhi elite, and ignored 
        by the majority; is in an isomorphic process of implosion. The remnants 
        of the previous relationship between the urban and the rural is in the 
        process of re-establishing a trade network, on all levels of stratified 
        Indian life. This network is not a simple meshwork of interlocking elements, 
        ready to trade at any cost; but requires the permutation of possible dispersal 
        mechanisms to be experimented with. The necessary capital flows must not 
        be acceded by the hierarchical reintegration of unsubstantive status and 
        the establishment. The Brahmin are a key element in this network realisation. 
      <p> Unlike the Christian West, the Brahmin do not straightforwardly suffer 
        from effete moral dehabilitation. The quandary and oscillation between 
        good and evil; is not a consideration. The life draining focus on the 
        weak is not as such a problem. The Brahmin reflect the multifarious relationship 
        between Land and City. Theirs is a social code; and one which may be coherently 
        transfered into a productive synthesis in an information environment. 
        They shall be the organisers of Bangalore. They will be fighters in the 
        war on the net. 
      <p> You twitch on the table. A metallic pain is thumping through your head. 
        A faint techno-Indian tune stimulates the memory to olfactory delight; 
        dancing, bright colours, the sensual feel of a ceremony. Perhaps Kali 
        has been painting the world; it seems to be full of life, the repetition 
        of the same has been replaced by the taste of a web; female warriors, 
        by the delicious scent of the kill permeating your mind. Yet it isn't 
        real, its another perverse illusion, another digital piece of make-believe. 
        You vibrate between two realities; the awakened Asian, the deadened European, 
        yet the choice is not so stark, one does not feed off of the other. The 
        relationship has been already established, it has already been played 
        through. </font>
      <p><font size="2"> A different God on the arc lights up. Its gaze takes 
        your fear away, it makes you believe in your fate. The decoration, the 
        clatter of the mechanical sound takes away some of the pain. The patterns 
        and signs of belief signal diversions, they are wrapped up, presented 
        on the table, as metal interactions accelerate between them;- they become 
        speed, explode and disappear in the chiming reverberations of the score. 
        The score is decoded by the attendant, he lurches away, deliberately, 
        awkwardly. Then you realise;- the score, he has the score, what is he 
        going to do with it? Where is he taking it? Why do you have to keep playing 
        this ridiculous game? Another ball bearing fires, it flies off into the 
        chaos of war;- combat, mutilated body parts, triggered islands of information.......
