        The cornerstone of transcendent culture is Man. Mankind, the Ubiquitous

        God's image. Natural Evolution to a Solid state, no need to go on, Stabilising

        Fin de Siecle. Masculinity is the pervasive (aesthetic) illusion of transcendence. 
        (Masculine) Order can only be temporal, a traced superimposition creating 
        an illusion of order in kaos. It is "riding the surf of their present,

        surface, the eruption prepared itself. The heat of liquid subjugation 
        boiled frantically against the sedimented crust of the masculine. All 
        which is not masculine opposes (the) logic of constancy, (the) logic of 
        the straight, (the) logic of capital, (the) logic of structure, (the) 
        logic of discipline. </font>

        is greater than that of the sea. And the man has still to come who will 
        live that love out beyond the reach of any port. Letting go of his rock, 
        his ship, his island, and even that last drop of oil on the water, and 
        so that he can feel the intoxication of such vastness. (Irigaray,1991:47)

        overboard. The solidity and stability of the boat pale in comparison to 
        the strength (and beauty) of the ocean. The facade of masculinity is inadequate 
        protection against Her might, but it is here at the Queer outpost that 
        the security system must be tested. When this sea bears its teeth, masculinity

        enforced by law, but no one could leave even if they chose to. The agents 
        of disciplined masculine excess, trapped in an agoraphobic consensual 
        hallucination; a facade masking the lack of anywhere REAL to go. REAL
