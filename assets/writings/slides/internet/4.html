		<li>Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961.
		    <li>Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking.
			<li>Packet Switching: <i>The routing and transferring of data by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic</i>
			    <li> 1965, working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built.
				<li> came to realization that the time-shared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job -- Kleinrock's conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.
