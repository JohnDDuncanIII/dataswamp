	<P>
		"Lowtech" means technology that is cheap or free.
	</P>

	<P>
		Technology moves on so fast that right now we can
		recover low-end Pentiums and fast Macintoshes from the
		trash. Lowtech upgrades every year. But we don't have to
		pay for it.
	</P>

	<P>
		Lowtech includes hardware and software. We advocate
		freeware and low cost software. We particularly advocate
		the use of low cost, open source operating systems.
	</P>

	<P>
		High technology doesn't mean high creativity. In fact
		sometimes the restrictions of a medium lead to the most
		creative solutions.
	</P>

	<P>
		Independence is important. Don't lock your creativity
		into a box you don't control.
	</P>

	<P>
		Access is important. Don't lock your creativity into a
		format we can't see.
	</P>

	<P>
		High tech artworks market new PCs. Even if they aren't
		meant to. Artworks that make use of new, expensive
		technology can't avoid being, in part, sales
		demonstrations. Part of the message of an online video
		stream, whatever its content, is &quot;Hey, isn't it time
		for an upgrade?&quot;.
	</P>

	<P>
		Communicators concerned with the meaning and context of
		what they do may want to avoid this.
	</P>

	<P>
		We're skeptical about the consumerist frenzy associated
		with information technology. Lowtech questions the two
		year upgrade cycle.
	</P>

	<P>
		A lot of people say that new media is revolutionary.
		They say the net is anarchic and subversive. But how
		subversive can you be in an exclusive club, with a
		$1000 entrance fee?
	</P>

	<P>
		Lowtech counters exclusivity. Lowtech is street level
		technology.
	</P>

	<P>
		Text is great for communicating. Write down what you
		want to say. Make it clear and simple and non-exclusive.
	</P>

	<P>
		Email is still the &quot;killer app&quot;. Fast, low cost
		global communication for the ordinary citizen is
		genuinely something new.
	</P>

	<P>
		HTML is good for lots more than web pages. Now you can
		author all sorts of graphical stuff with a plain text editor.
	</P>

	<P>
		Use the web for plain text and images. It's simple and
		cheap and quick and it works.
	</P>
