<h2>6. Caveat Emptor</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook
    mistakes.&quot;</i></p>
  <p align="right"><i>--&nbsp;James T. Kirk, in Star Trek episode
    &quot;Space Seed&quot;, stardate 3141.9</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously Microsoft doesn't have the slightest respect for their customers
(note how I try to avoid the word 'contempt' here). Their track record speaks
louder than words on this point. Microsoft is a truly digital company:
Microsoft is number one, and the millions of consumers who use their products
are the zero's.<br />
Before doing business with any company, most customers like to know if they're
dealing with a reliable party. Well&nbsp;-&nbsp;to summarize:</p>

<h3>User problems not addressed directly</h3>
<p>Microsoft rarely fixes user problems. Granted, service packs for Windows
'95, NT, Office and such have been released, but only in an attempt to fix
blunders that should never have been released in the first place. And each
new service pack introduces new (and untested) features to Windows, so the
problem is always perpetuated.<br />
Instead of solving problems with new interim releases, MS issues only major
new releases with 'additional features' and loads of extra bells and whistles
that distract the attention from the main issue: software quality. Could
someone tell me what the real structural improvements there were in the latest
Windows ME release?</p>

<h3>No apparent quality control</h3>
<p>Microsoft does not seem to have a quality plan, carries no ISO900x (or any
other) quality certification that I know of, and apparently does not intend to
acquire any. Worse, Microsoft does not seem to have full control over the
contents of their own software. The
<a href="http://www.iwr.co.uk/News/602239">'Weenie Issue'</a> in IIS and the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;281923">'Gray hair issue'</a> are good examples. Granted, these may be relatively
harmless bits of code, but the point is that if these can pass through
Quality Control, so can serious flaws, security backdoors and the like. That's
assuming that quality control is actually part of Microsoft's production
process and that it's intended to do a serious job. If it were serious, it
would have frowned upon hidden flight simulator and pinball games in release
versions of Office. (Such deliberately hidden features are called 'Easter Eggs'
and are usually put in by developers as a prank.)</p>

<h3>Millennium bugs forever</h3>
<p>In 1998 Microsoft released one of their major products (Windows '98) that
turned out not to be millennium-proof. After <em>no fewer than five</em>
service packs for NT4, users still needed to install several post-SP Y2K
hotfixes by the end of 1999.  (Can you say &quot;Quality Assurance&quot;?)</p>

<h3>No support on OEM sales</h3>
<p>Microsoft refuses to support their own products if those products have
been sold to the customer through an OEM distributor.</p>

<h3>Products further Microsoft's own interests</h3>
<p>Microsoft products are designed to benefit Microsoft. Even in the days of
Windows 3.11, they incorporated code to display an incorrect error message if
the competing product DR-DOS was detected. How does the customer benefit from
this? Microsoft uses their customer base as a pawn in the battle for
market domination. Windows '98 forces the user to run Internet Explorer,
regardless of the needs, desires and wishes of said user. There is no
technical reason to do so, it is a monopoly issue only, as has been proven
in the course of legal procedures against Microsoft. And who else but
Microsoft would put a feature in MSN Explorer to spam your entire address
book with endorsement messages gushing praise about &quot;this exciting new
product from Microsoft&quot;? (Incidentally, this spam <em>has your name on
it.</em> It's <em>your</em> reputation going down the drain.)</p>

<h3>Microsoft sabotages alternatives</h3>
<p>Microsoft manipulates the market by making it cumbersome to use
competing products instead of offering truly better alternatives, enforces
proprietary extensions to otherwise open standards and introduces deliberate
version conflicts.</p>

<h3>Doubtful business practice</h3>
<p>Microsoft is not above playing fast-and-loose with the law when it comes
to killing off alternative suppliers. They prefer to use pressure and force
to restrict the consumer's free choice, rather than to allow true and
healthy competition based on the merits of different products. Their methods
to accomplish this can be called doubtful from a legal point of view, to say
the least.</p>

<h3>Microsoft spreads lies</h3>
<p>Microsoft lies to the customer (yes, they <em>LIE</em>) to deny the
quality of competing products and to make their own look more favorable.
Microsoft will look you straight in the face and tell you that NDS is known
for poor scalability, that Netware doesn't support basic file system features
such as sub-allocation and compression, and that Windows outperforms
Unix.</p>

<h3>Forced upgrades</h3>
<p>With the introduction of Office XP, Microsoft resorts to a new upgrade
policy: force-feeding. You'll upgrade whenever Microsoft tells you to and
meet their deadline, or else face a huge cost increase the next time you
upgrade. That's the kind of freedom of choice that Microsoft gives you:
either pay up now for something you don't really need, or pay much more a
little later when (not if) new products will be made incompatible with
previous versions.</p>

<p>Still Microsoft hails the free market and tells the customers that they
benefit from this.<br />
Uh-huh.</p>
