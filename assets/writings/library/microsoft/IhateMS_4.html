<h2>4. World domination</h2>
<p><img src="MSimages/billgatus.jpg" border="0" width="90" height="120"
  class="right" alt="" />
&quot;<i>I am Billgatus of Borg. Resistance is futile.</i>&quot;<br /><br />
Microsoft has been compared to the Borg Collective more than once. Indeed,
you don't have to be a hard-core Star Trek fan to notice the similarity
between Microsoft and the Borg. Microsoft's marketing methods have always
shown a certain hunger for power, but lately an undisguised megalomania has
set in.<br />
&quot;WE ARE MICROSOFT. LOWER YOUR FIREWALLS AND SURRENDER. WE WILL ADD YOUR
TECHNOLOGICAL DISTINCTIVENESS TO OUR OWN. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE
IS FUTILE.&quot;</p>

<h3>Competitors beware</h3>
<p>It's long been known that to oppose Microsoft means certain death
(commercially speaking of course). Microsoft's marketing division just
tramples the corpse of anyone who thinks he can shift it left or right.
In fact, during its recent competitive struggles with information provider
Google, Microsoft has stated that they want to destroy Google. Not compete
with it, but destroy it. Google provides some of the most popular and useful
services currently available on the Internet, but Microsoft would like to
see it destroyed. The fact that they have not been able to carry out this
threat hardly matters; their position is clear.</p>

<p>Microsoft's stragegy (and, therefore, its technological developments)
are directed only at extracting more and more money from the customer,
and at continuing to do so in the future. The customers' needs are
irrelevant. Microsoft's preferred way of accomplishing this prime directive
is to sabotage alternatives to Microsoft products and to use any means
available to eliminate competitors, rather than to bring real technological
innovation.</p>

<p>Microsoft's sheer marketing power has grown to the point where it can
hurt competitors even by merely threatening them. We see this curious
effect throughout the entire software market: as soon as Microsoft targets
a certain part of the market, something happens to the competing market
leaders. They start to falter. The value of their stock market shares
drop. Their strategy becomes erratic and looses focus, and ultimately
the quality of their products suffers. Novell and Netscape, to name
a few good examples, have lost a good deal of their market share this
way. Of course these companies have made mistakes. Of course they have
ruined the potential of superior products with bungled marketing and
disastrous commercial strategies. Of course Apple, IBM and all the others
have done the same. Of course they only have themselves to blame for an
inadequate reaction to a threat they should and could have expected.
Of course the ability and the guts to deal with competitive pressure
is a required part of doing business: if you can't stand the heat, stay
out of the kitchen. But even so, their fairly typical behavior is a good
illustration of the blind fear that Microsoft's business practices have
managed to instill in would-be competitors, because everyone knows that
Microsoft's use of FUD campaigns, corruption of standards, forced partner
agreements, product bundling and other monopolist practices have become
almost impossible to counter.</p>

<p>This fear is not without ground. Competitors who offer alternative and
sometimes better technology are ruthlessly crushed, not because MS offers
a better product but because Microsoft can manipulate the users and the
software market to cut off anyone's oxygen supply without even making a dent
in their profits, and still have their marketing division make enough noise
to drown out all the other players in the market.</p>

<h3>Forced sales</h3>
<p>Microsoft has had PC manufacturers by the short-and-curlies for
years: if integrators wanted to pre-load an OEM version of Windows on
the computers they sold, then they <em>had to</em> discontinue all
products from Microsoft's competitors. If they wouldn't sign such a
contract to bundle a pre-loaded version of Windows with <em>all</em>
their shipped systems, they'd face a hefty increase in Windows license
fees. In other words: either they had to sell a copy of Windows with all
their shipped systems and nothing else, or they would face retaliatory
measures from Microsoft, which meant that they wouldn't be able to
offer a copy of Windows at a competitive price.  Only in recent years
the largest PC manufacturers have been allowed to support Linux to a
certain degree. (Note that the above may not apply in all countries
and to all OEM manufacturers. Local policies may differ, and smaller
system integrators pay different prices and have different contracts
with Microsoft than huge companies do. Your mileage may vary.)</p>

<p>This strategy of forced sales is an old one: the same has been done in
the past when PC vendors were forced to bundle Windows 3.1 with new PCs
in order to be allowed to ship MS-DOS. Even before they modified Windows
3.x to crash when it detected the presence of DR-DOS instead of MS-DOS,
Microsoft adopted several tactics to destroy DR-DOS. The most damaging of
these was tying PC makers into secret per-processor license agreements,
which meant that they paid for Microsoft's MS-DOS whether they shipped
it with the PC or not, foreclosing the most important route to market.</p>

<p>Also note how Microsoft makes is cumbersome to legitimately re-use
a Windows XP or Vista license. The license is tied to the computer's
hardware, both with the activation system and with the requirement to
affix the serial number of the license to the computer's exterior. To
remove the software from one machine and transfer it to another one is a
pain, even though such a transfer is normal practice with other software
products, and the Windows End User License Agreement (EULA) does not
prohibit it. Yes, it <i>is</i> possible to legally remove Windows from
one PC and install it on another one, but that requires a telephone call
to Microsoft to have the transfer authorized.<br /> As if this wasn't
bad enough, Microsoft arbitrarily changed the OEM license agreement
several years after the release of Windows XP, to state that replacing
the mainboard of a computer essentially creates a new computer, <i>which
requires a new license for the operating system</i>, and they sent a <a
href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/e/3/4e3eace0-4c6d-4123-9d0c-c80436181742/OSLicQA.doc">memo</a>
to its OEM partners requesting to enforce this new policy.</p>

<p>Another needless restriction is that an OEM version shipped with one
brand of computer will not accept a (legal) serial number issued with
another hardware brand. This can make it difficult or impossible to modify
(e.g. add specific drivers to) an OEM version of XP, or to re-install
XP if the original CD (but not the license) shipped with the hardware
has been lost. In spite of the fact that you have paid for a legal end
user license, the licensing system effectively prevents you from using
it.</p>

<p>The EULA for Office is just as brutal in its own way: if you want
to use just Word, PowerPoint or Excel on a single PC, you still have
to license the entire Office package. Nor are you permitted to use Word
on one PC and Excel on another under the same license; you <i>must</i>
buy a separate license for the entire Office suite for each PC.</p>

<p>But hey -- if you're working in education, Microsoft wants to be
your friend! For a few bucks per seat you'll get all the licenses you
want. Since budgets in the educational sector are usually tight, a batch
of almost free software is a godsend. Or is it? Maybe not. The small
print in these &quot;education-friendly&quot; licenses <em>prohibits
running anything but Microsoft products</em> on the systems that run
under an educational license, including free Open Source alternatives
(e.g. Star Office). They'd make it illegal to mention non-MS products
to students at all if they could find a way to pull that off. Nor is
this the only example of Microsoft meddling with the curriculum. In
August 2002 Microsoft made a controversial donation of 2.3 million
dollars to the University of Waterloo, Canada, on the condition
that the university would teach their students Microsoft's new C#
programming language as a <i>mandatory subject</i> for students entering
the university's Electrical and Computer Engineering programme.</p>

<p>With these things in mind it's rather ironic that as part of their
settlement with the DoJ for anti-competitive practices in November
2001, Microsoft agreed to supply schools with software, hardware and
services. What a great chance for Microsoft to kill two birds with one
stone. They get to control the curriculum and expose the students to
a Microsoft-only environment before they enter the work force, and
they meet the conditions of the settlement at the same time!</p>

<p>Needless to say that Microsoft's efforts to rigidly control PC
suppliers have been very effective. If you're a consumer, you'll find
that it's nearly impossible to buy an A-brand PC without a bundled
Windows license. Recently some large PC manufacturers offer Linux to the
corporate market, but these exceptions are still few and far between,
and an A-brand PC without an operating system (which would in itself
be quite legitimate) is generally unavailable. On a propaganda webpage
aimed squarely at OEM resellers, Microsoft went to considerable lengths
to blacken the reputation of what it terms &quot;Naked PCs&quot;. A
Naked PC is a PC that you can (or rather, you can't) buy without an
operating system. Try it, you'll find it's really quite difficult in
any case, and Microsoft wants OEMs to make it even more difficult by
refusing to sell you one. &quot;Think of selling a house without a roof
- selling your customers Naked PCs leaves them equally exposed&quot;,
says Microsoft. &quot;If you allow your customers to buy Naked PCs -
placing them at risk of acquiring pirated operating systems elsewhere
- you expose them to legal risks, viruses, and frustrating technical
troubles.&quot; In other words the customer <em>has</em> to buy Windows,
it's for his own good. In fact, it should be made illegal to buy a PC
without Windows, because Microsoft continues with: &quot;And even if
your customer manages to illegally acquire and install operating systems
elsewhere...&quot; Apparently it's either inconceivable or immoral to
consider alternatives for Windows, and installing products such as Linux
or FreeBSD is a crime.</p>

<h3>No Windows? We'll get you</h3>
<p>In May 2001, Microsoft took this idiocy even further. Several local
hardware integrators in the US were offered rewards for reporting their
customers who buy PCs without a Windows user license. Yes, I'm serious. If
you buy a PC and you plan to run Linux or FreeBSD on it, you automatically
become a suspect and Microsoft puts a price on your head.</p>

<p>And there's no way out of this nonsense. In cases where large customers build
their own PCs in order to avoid putting too much  money in Microsoft's
pocket, they can't use their volume license programs as the basis for
installing Windows. Those volume programs only allow upgrades of systems that
have been purchased with original Windows licenses. They can't even save some
money and build their own computers or buy them from a local whitebox shop
without also tacking on a Windows license.  By contract the OEMs are required
to report any customer that requests 'naked PCs' and it often triggers a
software contract audit by Microsoft, sometimes followed by seven figure
surprise bills.</p>

<h3>Fear campaign</h3>
<p>Microsoft will enforce the conditions in their license agreements with
a heavy hand, if need be. Or rather, they use the BSA (Business Software
Alliance) as their enforcer. The BSA is a trade group that helps enforce
copyrights and licensing provisions for large business software manufacturers.
Steve Ball, CEO of the famous guitar string manufacturing company Ernie Ball,
said in an interview:</p>

<blockquote><i>
&quot;I became an open-source guy because we're a privately owned company, a
family business that's been around for 30 years, making products and being a
good member of society. We've never been sued, never had any problems paying
our bills. And one day I got a call that there were armed marshals at my door
talking about software license compliance. [...] They basically shut us down.
We were out of compliance I figure by about 8 percent (out of 72 desktops).
[...]<br />
How did this happen? We pass our old computers down. The guys in engineering
need a new PC, so they get one and we pass theirs on to somebody doing
clerical work. Well, if you don't wipe the hard drive on that PC, that's a
violation. Even if they can tell a piece of software isn't being used, it's
still a violation if it's on that hard drive.&quot;
</i></blockquote>

<p>Similar practices abound in Europe. Many companies in Holland have
received threatening letters from Microsoft (and Microsoft lawyers)
with thinly veiled accusations of software piracy. Apparently Microsoft
assumes that large companies should have at least a certain number of
Windows and Office licenses, and at least as many Office licenses as they
have Windows licenses. Large companies with a smaller number of licenses
than Microsoft thought they should have were ordered to present complete
and accurate information about their numbers of servers, PCs and software
licenses. Failure to comply with this order in full would result in audits
and legal procedures. Apparently Microsoft considers it unthinkable that
PCs can be used for purposes other than running Windows or Office.</p>

<p>A few months later Microsoft hired a law firm to target an even broader
selection of small businesses, who were more or less ordered to submit a
complete and comprehensive list of all Microsoft products in their possession.
Again there was the thinly veiled threat that failure to comply with this
order would have &quot;legal consequences&quot;.</p>

<p>What other type of company but an utterly ruthless monopolist would have the
arrogance to threaten and intimidate their own customers like this?</p>

<h3>Killing off the competition</h3>
<p>If you're a competing software developer, things are even worse.  A
Microsoft version of the software that keeps you in business could be
integrated with the next release of Windows, or given away for free as a
separate product. Microsoft has used this and other tactics (such as
deliberate vaporware announcements) many times in the past to smother
innovation and break innovative developers.</p>

<p>If you're too big to be eliminated like that, Microsoft still controls
whether or not your software will be compatible with future releases of
Microsoft products. A classic example is MS Office on OS/2 Warp: several
components (most noticably Word) were tailored to crash on OS/2. This
strategy has continued ever since: when Windows XP came out, it wouldn't
run the then-current versions of RealPlayer and Quicktime... but of course
XP did come with an integrated MS Media player. Several years earlier,
when I subjected a brand-new Compaq Deskpro (running NT Workstation)
to the Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Check, guess what happened:
all installed Novell products were found to be incompatible with
Windows 2000. What a surprise. Fortunately my trashcan was Windows
2000 Ready...</p>

<p>Apart from the above measures, there's always brute force. The blind fear
that Microsoft's legal department has managed to instill in some independent
developers (especially the smaller companies) is nicely illustrated by what
happened to Ghisler &amp; co, a small Swiss developer. Ghisler's primary
product, a file manager that is essentially a Windows version of previous
DOS-based file managers such as Norton Commander, is especially popular among
power users and administrators. Ghisler had shipped Windows Commander for
no less than nine years, when a letter from Microsoft claimed ownership of
the word 'Windows' in the product name 'Windows Commander' and demanded
that the name be changed. Ghisler not only immediately complied wih the
demand to avoid legal repercussions, but also put Microsoft trademark
notices on the homepage of their website, released a
<a href="http://www.ghisler.com/name.htm">bulletin</a> that avoided the
word 'Microsoft' entirely but only referred to &quot;the owner of the
trademark 'Windows'&quot;, and even requested their users not to make
negative comments in their forums. Such is the reputation of Microsoft's
lawyers.</p>

<p>Nor is this reputation undeserved. Shortly after Ghisler &amp;
co required a change of underwear, the seventeen year old Canadian
Mike Rowe decided, mainly as a lark, to put 'soft' behind his name and
register his own domain. Microsoft's lawyers then demanded that Rowe cease
and desist his &quot;copyright infringements&quot; and hand over his domain
name. Rowe suggested compensation. Microsoft's lawyers offered Rowe 10 (ten)
dollars. Rowe did not consider that a serious offer and demanded more. The
Microsoft lawyers then hit him with a 25-page document that accused him
of price gauging and promised legal actions. As said, Rowe was all of 17
years old at the time.</p>

<p>By now the field is littered with the carcasses of software companies
that held a share of the market that Microsoft decided they wanted. For
example, does anyone remember an upstart company named Argonaut? They
were one of the few small companies that made excellent 3D rendering
software in the early nineties, years before the technology became
widely available on the PC. We had to wait for it all those years,
though, because Microsoft bought Rendermorphic, one of Argonaut's
their competitors, and started to give away their software licenses for
free. This killed off all developments at Argonaut and the other small
3D developers of those days in short order, and it meant the end of
another piece of innovation.</p>

<h3>Vaporware works</h3>
<p>Selling vaporware is one of Microsoft's favorite tactics to sabotage their
competitors. The idea is simple: announce a revolutionary, new product or
technology that will make your competitors' products obsolete right away, and
everyone becomes reluctant to invest in those competing products. By the time
you eventually release something (that may or may not resemble whatever you
announced) the competition will be gone, or at least on the way out. And if
truth be told, Microsoft has this technique down to a fine art. Few others
are as good at it as Redmond's marketeers.</p>

<p>A good example of their masterful control of vaporware selling was
the initial announcement of the .Net initiative. .Net was essentially
announced as a whole new product line, to which all existing products
were going to be converted. It was going to be the future of computing,
if we were to believe Microsoft. And it was hard not to believe them,
because they were already advertising &quot;.Net Connected Software&quot;
as if it were an available product instead of a concept that hadn't even
laid down a set of final specifications yet. And it
worked: in an attempt to capitalize on the hysteria, third parties were
falling over themselves to jump on the .Net bandwagon. It rapidly became
a fashionable buzzword that CEO's hastily declared commitment to. The
press especially paid a lot of lip service to .Net, and all major book
and magazine publishers were in a hurry to flood the market with .Net
publications. Whole series of books about .Net were being released,
regardless the fact that <i>.Net hadn't materialized yet</i> and even
the exact specifications did not yet exist!</p>

<p>Eventually all .Net turned out to be was a framework for the
development of network applications. As such it's a typical Microsoft
product: it's an attractive environment for application developers,
but with serious drawbacks. It offers powerful features that often
don't perform very well, and it ties developers firmly to the Microsoft
platform.</p>
 
<h3>Sales: from promises to lies</h3>
<p>Microsoft Products are sold not on their technical merits, but by
brute force and sheer marketing violence. IT Managers read in their
investment magazines that Microsoft Is The Future. They attend a few
management seminars or other sponsored events, they are exposed to a
few sales presentations that are long on promises and short on facts,
and so they become convinced that they have to switch to Microsoft
products. After all, everyone is using Windows so it must be a good
thing. Of course the same thing could be said about pot, with as much
validity. The only difference is that you can't Just Say No to Windows.</p>

<p>Microsoft products are peddled to the corporate sector mainly through
high-level selling. Large-account managers directly approach the top
executives of the companies they wish to target. During tasteful lunch
meetings they spin a glorious tale about how more investments in the
Microsoft platform would have &quot;strategic advantages&quot; for the
whole company. They make sure to use terms like &quot;installed base&quot;
and &quot;target threshold&quot; repeatedly. They cite success stories,
they mention Fortune 500 companies, they emphasize the importance
of keeping strategic decisions on the executive level. They mention
in passing that Windows has removed the need for computer techies in
making informed decisions about computing, so now boardroom executives are 
qualified to select operating systems as part of their corporate strategy
planning. And if the technical staff happens to disagree about the wisdom
of switching to Windows, well, that's only because the techies feel that
their turf is being threatened by the introduction of an operation system
that removes the need for skilled personnel, and because they lack insight
into strategic matters.</p>

<p>Of course these marketroids never even mention such unimportant
details as the need for more and bigger servers than other products
would require, or the fact that uptime and availability are only a
fraction of that of competing products. Oh no. They also gloss over
what people in the field think about what goes on under the hood of
Microsoft products (after all, techies have never been realists) and they
blissfully ignore the numerous implementation problems (excuse me, I mean
'challenges') that come with each new version of any Microsoft product
you care to mention. Instead they emphasize that all large companies
have &quot;switched to Windows&quot;, so it has to be a Good Thing. They
promise that the latest Windows Server will speed up the business and save
millions of dollars per year, but of course they forget to mention that
they're comparing it to Windows NT4, released in 1996. And if all this
doesn't do the job, they cinch the deal with an offer that the customer
can't refuse, such as a 50% discount on software licenses, and if it's
about a choice between a Windows environment and Open Source software,
they'll even happily give away licenses for free. Not that those licenses
are so overpriced that they'd still make a profit at half the price or
less, oh no, of course not. The offer should merely be seen as a quantity
discount for an especially valued customer.</p>

<h3>A real world example</h3>
<p>I'm not making this up. I've seen it happen in large companies all
around me. This is how the game is being played. The following response
from a British reader (a corporate user who wishes to remain anonymous)
illustrates this fairly well:</p>

<blockquote><i>
We decided to use FreeBSD, Apache, mySQL+PostgreSQL, Perl+PHP [as Open Source
alternatives to Microsoft products]. The company I am working with is a
pure-Microsoft company, i.e. they only used to use Microsoft software, and
they even didn't know anything about Open Source. [...] When the local
Microsoft rep &quot;heard&quot; about it (someone inside the company
tipped them off), they asked to meet my team(!) and discuss the
reasons for our Open Source use.<br />
In fact, it was a meeting of 2 1/2 hours with 3 Microsoft sales/consulting
reps trying to persuade us not to use Open Source (mainly they talked about
Linux until we told them that we don't use Linux and that we don't understand
what they are talking about :-) because &quot;it is inherently insecure,
unreliable&quot; and, what was their biggest argument, &quot;there is nobody
in this country who could give you any support for Open Source&quot;,
etc. Also, they wanted (actually they <i>required!</i>) us to tell them the
reasons why we are using Open Source instead of the already introduced and
long-time proven Microsoft Software in this company. I started explaining
[...] and when we came to the point of 'Licensing Costs', they offered us
to give the Windows server licenses for free.<br />
I am not kidding. When I told them that I'd need at least ten licenses and
at $400/each, too much for me to begin with, they offered to give us the
license for free - and not only for now, but also for the future when we
kept working on Microsoft.
</i></blockquote>

<p>Commercial brute force is not the way to introduce new software standards.
If software retail stores open at midnight so that people can rush off with a
new Windows '95 package <em>the very minute it is released</em>, it's obvious
that OS implementation is no longer based on common sense or rational
decisions, but merely on a stampeding software market that has been hyped into
hysteria. It's obvious that something here is very, very wrong.</p>

<h3>Keeping the customer ignorant</h3>
<p>I'm not into conspiracy theories, but still I think it's interesting
to note how Microsoft has progressed from an upstart software company
to a party that attempts to control not only the market but even public
opinion.</p>

<p>Educating the masses was an important step in Microsoft's strategy. It
had long been common knowledge that &quot;computers are difficult to
use&quot;. Indeed, a system like Unix or DOS has never been known for its
user-friendliness, requiring the user to use a keyboard to type commands
like 'ls', 'rm' (Unix), 'REN' or 'DRIVPARM' (DOS). The steep
learning curve ensured that users would eventually be
fairly computer-literate (which was good) but also that few would succeed in
or even start the time-consuming, difficult and expensive learning process
(which was definitely bad).</p>

<p>The Graphic User Interface (GUI) in MS Windows put an end to all that. It
offered an attractive, accessible and friendly-looking interface, designed so
that it wouldn't scare the novice user. This has played a large role in
making the PC available to the masses, and Microsoft deserves due
credit for that, even though GUI's aren't and have never been Microsoft
technology.</p>

<p>But in their zeal to shield the poor novice users from confusing or
intimidating glimpses at the underlying technology that might frighten
them, Microsoft has actually oversimplified the interface. Users simply
drag and drop, unable to determine the difference between local 'folders'
and those on network servers. They don't know that a local 'folder' is
not the same as a server mapping, and they're unaware that 'My Documents'
is in fact a subdirectory that may reside on a local disk <em>or</em> on
a network server.  In fact, usually they have no idea what a subdirectory
is. So they simply right-click a document (which is represented by an
icon) to 'send it' to a 'mail recipient' without knowing that they are
in fact pushing an uncompressed 12 megabyte BMP file through an E-mail
server and an Internet link.</p>

<p>Even worse: not only are users ignorant of what happens in response
to a simple mouse click, but the Windows environment actually makes it
difficult for them to find out. At least the pre-Windows user interfaces
eventually stimulated the user to gain
some insight in what he or she was doing, and what the results of seemingly
innocent actions could be. Nowadays even the computer-literate have
trouble understanding what goes on behind the facade of the Windows GUI. Users
are actually being conditioned to associate daily tasks with Window GUI
elements. By the time they have managed to change their preference settings so
that Windows displays filename extensions and they can see what kind of file
they're dealing with instead of just seeing 'documents', they're no longer
average users.</p>

<p>Apart from all that, expecting a systems or network administrator or an
experienced user to work with the user interface that comes with Microsoft
products is a bad joke at best. Imagine an operating system that won't let
you tell it what you want, but lets you point at a picture instead and then
does for you what it thinks best. I can imagine a three-year-old preferring
it that way, but not a mature ICT professional. Of course GUI-based system
administration has its advantages, at least from a certain perspective, i.e.
a Windows-using ICT manager's perspective. Large-scale, properly set up Windows
networks with a ton of hardware and GUI management tools all over the shop
needn't cost a lot in terms of machine minders, whereas a Unix or Open Source
based network without these tools will need the requisite number of skilled
geeks to mumble incantations over shell prompts. But this is comparing apples
and pears: the geeks will serve you better than the deskilled machine minders
will when something goes badly wrong (which it will). The GUI has put on a lot
of weight in recent years, but in the end it serves more to restrict than to
enhance, limiting the users' understanding of, and control over, their
computers and software. The GUI removes all transparency from the system, so
that power users and sysadmins no longer have access to the underlying
processes.</p>

<h3>Limitations perceived as ease of use</h3>
<p>It's interesting to see how a lack of options is often confused with ease
of use. Granted, any appliance that only has one big red button marked 'On'
is easy to use. But don't expect it to be useful for more than one major
purpose, or otherwise flexible.</p>

<p>Windows advocates often argue that only Windows (and certainly not its main
rival Linux) has understood the users' needs to use a computer
as a tool. They say: &quot;Could it be perhaps that Microsoft got to be a
multi million dollar company, precisely because it set out to build a simple
to use, easy to understand operating system? One that just works, out of the
box. Without the need to be a geek and spend all day configuring complicated
services and settings every time you want to make something happen.&quot;</p>

<p>One enraged reader of this paper even wrote:</p>

<blockquote><i>
&quot;I own a computer repair centre and deal with literally thousands of
home users a year. I would say 80% of my customer base are exactly
that, 'Users'. They know how to turn the thing on, they know what the
big blue 'e' in the middle of the desktop is for. Some of them
can even word process. But for the vast majority of them that's as far
as it goes.<br />
The problem with geeks is, they seem to inhabit their own little
world, where everyone is a computer 'expert' and all the answers are
black and white. Meanwhile here in the real world companies like
Microsoft understand that the majority of their customers are not.
That they view their computer as a functional item, a means to an end
and base their software purchasing decisions on which product will
allow them to do what they need to do, as simply and as quickly as
possible. Not for its technical merits or because they get aroused at
the thought of tweaking their system to perfection.&quot;

<p>This is essentially true. A computer should be a tool, a means to
an end.  However, Windows advocates often confuse a lack of options with
the lack of <i>a need for options</i>. They are right in that most users
just want an appliance, rather than a complicated assembly of software
that requires fine-tuning. On the other hand, an assembly of software
is all they get, and turning it into a simple and reliable appliance,
through fine-tuning or other means, is barely possible. And that is a
real problem.</p>

<p>The world is full of people who make you realize why an electric
hand mixer needs a warning label advising users to switch it off before
licking icing from the beaters. These geniuses are far better off with,
say, a well-configured Linux box, installed straight off some CD with
a few mouse clicks. This will let them do their jobs and still prevent
anyone without a root password from doing any damage.  Windows on the
other hand can be damaged by an end user through the mere installation
of an application. Yet it does not offer many options, neither for the
novice user nor for the professional, to track down and fix the problem,
since that would expose options that are more complex than a one-click
&quot;wizard&quot; feature. Windows is like a car with the hood welded
shut. If you don't know any better it may give you the idea that it
requires no maintenance or repair... until it breaks down, and that's
when the problems really start.</p>

<p>Windows pulls the wool over your eyes, and it does that very well. Its
many limitations are not apparent to the novice user. This is an important
factor in guiding the users' perceptions. Most average Windows users
are not aware that what they perceive as simplicity is in fact a lack
of sophistication. They just click on an icon, and when things do not
behave as advertised they enlist the help of a support technician. If
the technician is unable to adequately solve the problem due to Windows'
lack of transparency and manageability on the system level, they tend to
blame the technician and not the software. Most Windows advocates (who
generally call themselves power users and therefore should know better)
do the same.</p>

<h3>Closing the curtains on Windows</h3> <p>Contrary to popular belief,
a GUI is not ergonomic. For example it requires users to take their
hands off the keyboard and their eyes off the screen in order to operate
the mouse during word processing, and graphic fonts and black-on-white
text cause more eye strain than the old text-based equipment used to
do. Neither is a GUI conducive to productivity; although the learning
curve of a command line environment is steeper, after some training many
users can perform most operations faster through keyboard commands than
with a mouse.</p>

<p>Another headache for sysadmins is that GUI operations are essentially
impossible to script, so that with large numbers of servers it is
impractical to use the GUI to carry out installation tasks or regular
maintenance tasks.  Desktop users face the same problem: in the early
nineties it was possible to produce large amounts of personalized
correspondence using nothing but Word Perfect macros, a simple database
and a few batch files. In Windows most of these jobs have to be done by
hand, over and over again. In short, Microsoft tried to create products
that even a fool could use, but they ended up with something that only
a fool would want to use, given the chance to make an informed choice.</p>

<p>But then again, Microsoft's regard for their user community is best
illustrated by the useful tips in MS Word, my favorite of which has alway
been &quot;Don't run with scissors&quot;. And of course there was the
'log-on help' in Windows 2000 Professional: an explanation on how to
press the Ctrl, Alt and Delete keys, complete with a graphic animation
of those keys being indicated and depressed. The animated question mark
icon ("Any time you need help, click me with the mouse or press the F1
key. I'll be right  here if you need me!")  in the Windows XP Professional
installer is even more annoying, and bears an uncanny resemblance to the
animated help in MS Office. These 'professional versions' target the
'professional' user, who is apparently assumed to be unable to handle
complex operations such as accepting defaults in an install program or
even logging on without animated graphics as a guideline.</p>

<h3>Ignorant users are happy users</h3>
<p>In all fairness, technophiles have always been exasperated by the
'ignorance' of non-techies. But these days we're dealing with a generation
of users that can't even understand the need to know the basics. All
they have to do is double-click on a document, and things start to
happen. Of course as soon as the document's file extension (which is
hidden by default in the first place) isn't properly associated with
an application, the average user is immediately lost. Users have never
been invited to learn. They've been told that they no longer need to know
about the basics of driving, so they just expect their cars to take them
wherever they want to go today.</p>

<p>As a result of all this, average users don't even realize that computers
and Windows aren't a necessary combination, or that there is a distinction
between operating systems and the applications that run on it. They've been
taught to think of Windows as something that comes with your PC, or even as
something that is part of your PC. They have been told that Windows XP is a
multimedia environment. The idea that Windows XP is an <i>operating system</i>
that could, but not necessarily should, run multimedia <i>applications</i> is
completely beyond them. The thought that Windows is one of the many operating
systems that could be installed on a computer is just as alien to most of
them. To them all computers in the world are PC's running Windows.</p>

<h3>Today the user, tomorrow the world</h3>
<p>The rot has now spread so far that this misconception affects many
software and content developers. Web designers automatically assume that
their web sites will be viewed on a PC, and if you're lucky they'll write
code that runs on both Mozilla/Netscape <i>and</i> Microsoft browsers. (As
if those were the only ones around.)  Application developers usually
aren't much better either: they write software for Windows, period. Even
<em>they</em> just don't know any better. Even in Windows itself you can
see that portions of the code have been created by junior programmers who
have never known a more robust environment. Nor is this surprising. Most
IT students only encounter Windows these days. Most of them have never
seen a text-mode interface, they don't know that there are other OS's
than Windows out there or how they work, and their understanding of what
lies beneath the Windows GUI is rudimentary at best. They've never seen
robust software, let alone learned how to write any. Still these students
are supposed to become tomorrow's IT workers.</p>

<p>Quality standards have steadily dropped. The average user routinely endures
buggy software, computer crashes and loss of data. Think about it: To have
several computer crashes or forced reboots a week <em>is considered normal
and acceptable!</em> That is, by those who have never known anything but
a PC with Windows, which is most of today's user community. The thought
that it's not normal and acceptable for computers to crash or require
rebooting regularly never enters their minds.</p>

<p>Most computer users know computer technology only through Microsoft
products. They no longer learn about computing; the Windows user interface
discourages anything beyond point-and-click actions. Like toddlers
they point at small pictures and they think they are knowledgeable about
computers, while the marketeers wax lyrical about how easy and exciting it
all is, as long as we all keep buying more and more of the same junk.</p>

<p>And <i>that</i> is the basis on which many IT managers choose the platforms
for their future investments! That, and the comforting knowledge that
&quot;nobody ever got fired for buying Microsoft.&quot;</p>

<p>God help us.</p>

<h3>Power corrupts, absolute power is even better</h3>
<p>I used the word 'megalomania' above. You'll understand why if you take a
good look at Microsoft's plans for the future. Controlling the PC market is
not enough for Microsoft. In the near future we can expect to see them
move into different markets.</p>

<p>They're well on their way to flooding the market for handhelds with Windows
CE. They're trying to get Windows on the road by embedding it in automotive
electronics. They've briefly courted TV networking. They spun up their
marketing machine to take over the cellphone software market, starting with
Ballmer's claim that 25% of all multimedia cellphones will run Microsoft's
Smartphone 2002 operating system within three to five years. Fortunately
the first releases of Smartphone were such a disaster that most cellphone
manufacturers soon lost interest.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting new initiatives is Windows Media Center. This
is a special pre-installed version of Windows XP or Vista. Windows Media
Center won't be sold separately but comes with Multimedia Entertainment
Systems (which are essentially PCs with a TV tuner and a remote control).
This Windows version incorporates entertainment features like DVD-playing, 
recording TV programmes, and an application to manage and view digital photos.
It comes with a simplified user interface that can be read from across the room.
None of this is very innovative, but Media Center PC is likely to be just the
opening salvo in Microsoft's bid to control home entertainment in the same way
it already dominates home computing. In a few years a personal computer (or
something essentially like one but with a more purpose-specific design) could
be the heart of many families' entertainment centers, and Microsoft will
attempt to exercise control over it just like they do with the PC market.
At WinHEC 2003 Gates presented further plans to integrate your TV, stereo,
VCR, phone etc. (all of which are  devices that switch on immediately and
then just work) into the Windows PC (the device that doesn't).</p>

<p>Microsoft has also begun to sell their own gaming hardware with the release
of the Xbox gaming console. The reason that Microsoft is getting into games is
not readily apparent. Their explanation that they wanted to save the world from
Playstation domination is of course not to be taken seriously. As far as
domination is concerned, it's an interesting fact that IBM was Apple's sole
supplier of Power-PC chips, on which Apple's hardware architecture was based,
and which IBM produces in limited quantities. The Xbox uses several of these
IBM Power-PC chips. Now convincing IBM that it would be more profitable to do
business with Microsoft than with Apple was not very difficult. Fortunately
for Apple the company proved agile and resilient enough to adapt, and
it continues to thrive after a timely but forced switch to Intel chips.
Still the way in which the Xbox forced Apple through a major change in
hardware platforms is an interesting one.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is the simple but often overlooked fact that the
Xbox is not a PC. It's Microsoft's first attempt at widely deploying a
device that offers home entertainment, Internet access, multimedia functions
and (with a few software updates) any other recreational or home application
that you care to think of. Currently Microsoft's survival is tied to the
technological life cycle of the PC and Windows as a platform. The Xbox offers
Microsoft a valuable opportunity to play with technology that could be the
future of home entertainment and the ultimate replacement for the home PC.
The fact that Microsoft has rigidly tied the Xbox to its own internet-based
Xbox services (including in option to permanently disable the Xbox hardware
if Microsoft detects that it has been tampered with) bear this out.</p>

<p>But Microsoft's primary reasons to venture into the hardcore gaming market
are actually rather simple. PCs and hardware have gotten faster and more
powerful all the time, but the only applications that really tax those
resources are games (and lately, but to a far lesser degree, digital video).
Gamers tend to keep their hardware and the supporting operating systems up
to date, and therefore games are a powerful contribution to the update frenzy
that Microsoft thrives on. But game consoles have always been a competitor to
the PC, and therefore a threat to Windows. Microsoft has always tried to
exterminate all competition with fire and sword, but in order to do this they
needed to enter the market for game consoles themselves. In the late 1990's,
through a little known and rather half-hearted deal with Sega, they tried to
push Windows CE as an OS for console games. The unsurprising lack of success
of this idea and the subsequent demise of Sega went largely unnoticed, but
they did prove that just putting Microsoft software on a third party game box
doesn't work very well.</p>

<p>Therefore the Xbox was released and, being a Microsoft product, it gives MS
full control over what will and what won't run on it. Furthermore, Microsoft
attempts to further control the gaming community through online services, on
which more and more Xbox features will become heavily dependent in the
future. This fits in with Microsoft's plans to tie their customers down into
Internet-based subscription services to protect revenues. <i>That</i> is why
the Xbox exists. That is why Microsoft  introduced the Xbox in the US on a
500 million dollar PR budget, and why they continue it in spite of the fact
that the Xbox has only netted a loss since day one. Half a billion US dollars
to introduce a gaming console that doesn't even turn a profit&nbsp;-- think
about it.</p>

<h3>Controlling the Internet</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important new business for Microsoft is web services.
Microsoft is really getting into web content with MSN, its search engine,
their ill-fated and fortunately short-lived Passport services and other,
related projects. Windows XP and Vista come loaded with features designed to
lure the user into buying music online (from Microsoft and their partners),
have digital photos printed at the click of a mouse (through a Microsoft
online service), to browse MSN (which boosts Microsoft's advertising
revenues) and to shop online (using Microsoft's passport and payment services
in the process).</p>

<p>With these first steps, Microsoft has begun a gradual but deliberate change.
Microsoft the software monopolist is trying to become Microsoft the web services
monopolist. Also note that MSN does not make any profit. Instead Microsoft
needs to spend in the order of half a billion US$ each year (!) to keep it
operational. Obviously this investment contributes to inflated profits
elsewhere.</p>

<p>After more than a decade of having milked Windows for all it was worth, it's
becoming increasingly obvious that Windows revenues won't last forever. The
answer is both simple and complex: Microsoft needs to find a new way of
ensuring revenues in future years. Since Microsoft Windows and server products
are an excellent means of tying the user community to proprietary protocols
and services, it stands to reason to use it to leverage the user community
into a new dependency. Enter Microsoft's new Internet strategy.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. Start partnerships with large information
and service providers on the Internet, and plan to hurt competing
information providers (such as Google) as much as possible if they won't
co-operate. Then set up a bunch of web services, and bundle clients
that use those web services with Windows, so that the user will get
it &quot;for free&quot;. Gradually discontinue PC-based support for
these services in software. Start with trivial things like software
activation and registration, user authentication and software maintenance,
and then move on to things like payment services, address books and
appointment schedulers, and eventually to full-fledged web-based
applications. Initially offer the new services for free or for a low
entry fee, and when user dependency is at a sufficiently high level,
start charging serious subscription fees. And there you are.</p>

<p>This future has already begun. The first implementations of this new
strategy are already visible in Windows XP, and even more so in Vista.</p>

<h3>Control every keystroke</h3>
<p>Microsoft already controls the kind of software we buy and use. The
next step into the future is to seize control of the work that we do
and the way that we do it.</p>

<p>A major component of Microsoft's long-term future plans revolves around
Application Service Providing (ASP). The idea is to offer the applications
that we now use as an internet-based service. Microsoft or its partners
will host our Office applications for us, and we'll access them using
only a (thin) client system.  Microsoft promises huge reductions in TCO,
mainly because the installation, management and maintenance of server
and applications will be outsourced with this concept.</p>

<p>While ASP is of course touted as being innovative, basically it's a
step back to the decades-old mainframe-with-terminals approach. In fact,
all you need to become an ASP <em>today</em> is a Unix server, a bunch
of applications and some graphic terminals. Granted, the X protocol
is ugly and unsuited for anything but LAN's, but the implementation
of a more elegant and efficient client/server protocol layer (e.g. ICA
or something better) is relatively trivial. Still, notwithstanding the fact
that it's essentially retro-technology, at first sight ASP might not seem
such a bad idea. After all, we won't have to bother with local software
maintenance, and we'll only be charged for the actual use of services and
not for software licenses. This should simplify things no end, right?</p>

<p>Well... Think about it. The whole idea is that Microsoft will take
the application software that we now run locally, and host it for us
on their own Windows-based servers. First of all this raises questions
about reliability: will Microsoft's technology be up to a job that is
mission-critical to large parts of the planet? With incidents of some 30
million users having problems with the MSN Messenger instant messaging
service, caused by a malfunctioning disk controller on a buddy list
database server that took Microsoft over a week to fix, the prospects
aren't all that good.</p>

<p>Secondly, Microsoft will take the application software that we now buy,
and rent it out to us on a subscription or per-use basis. Yes, we'll save
money on one-time licenses and on local administration. How very decent
of Microsoft - after they inflated the costs of licensing and ownership
themselves. But will we actually save money in the long run? We'll have
to buy and run local client software from Microsoft. You can say what
you want about Microsoft products, but Lean&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Mean is
not the way to describe any of them. They'll need serious hardware,
and bugs and implementation problems are common. On top of that, ASP
will only shift the workload (and cost center) from local server and
application administration to Internetworking and network administration,
simply replacing one problem with another.</p>

<p>But the most worrisome aspect of a shift from Microsoft as a software
vendor to Microsoft as an Application Service Provider is that it means our
complete and utter day-to-day dependence on Microsoft <em>for earning our
daily wages</em>. We'll be forced to keep paying whatever subscription
fees Microsoft chooses to charge us. Even better, Microsoft will also be able
to control and monitor our daily work. Microsoft will control whether or
not our applications will run, Microsoft will control which services
and software products will be available to us, and Microsoft will know about
it each and every time we use an application (i.e. request a service from
Microsoft). If Microsoft wants to monitor each and every keystroke
in said applications or even look into our own corporate data, they'd have
no problem doing so. And If Microsoft isn't interested in our corporate
data, I'm sure someone will be. And that someone will be very happy with
the appalling lack of security in any Microsoft product so far.</p>

<h3>ASP and User lock-in</h3>
<p>If ASP ever takes off, we'll of course be forced to buy the client
software from Microsoft (most likely bundled with an advanced PC) since
adherence to open standards is something not even the most naive optimist
has reason to expect. Microsoft's application service is going to be a
closed system. Microsoft will control it, and therefore will control the
operational costs. Instead of having to pay an admittedly steep, but one-time,
license fee we'll now regularly pay a subscription fee, to be set by
Microsoft. After all, Microsoft's office application division is facing
a revenue problem, as more and more users refuse to buy yet another
version of MS Office for the sake of a few trivial &quot;improvements&quot;.
And we'll keep paying, because once we've switched from locally administered
software to the ASP model, we'll be committed to it. Trust me: a back-out
from a shift to Microsoft's new scheme will be costly.</p>

<p>But we'll have little choice: the ASP platform will be gradually
incorporated in all new versions of major Microsoft products. Each time
we're forced to buy another upgrade in order to maintain compatibility with
the rest of the world, a piece of the new framework comes with it, and
eventually the whole scheme will be forced upon us. Microsoft has announced
that the extensions to implement this new framework in existing OS products
will be free. Right.</p>

<p>Where have we heard this before? Microsoft has given away products for free
in the past: web browsers and media players come to mind. Each and every time
they gave away free software their ultimate purpose was to kill off a
competing product that might have offered a viable alternative to the user.
And now the ASP framework extensions will be free? Sure... Timeo Danaos et
dona ferentes.</p>

<h3>Forced updates and Trojan Horses</h3>
<p>Financial ties aren't the only kind of control that Microsoft will have
under the new ASP scheme. Currently we may choose to purchase software for
a one-time license fee and decide not to upgrade it. We may choose not to
embrace dubious concepts or empty hypes. We may choose to wait, or to skip
certain products or versions entirely. Under the ASP concept, Microsoft
won't allow us the freedom to do that. Microsoft controls our software,
period.</p>

<p>Take the auto-update features in the client software, for example. Our
client software will automatically be updated whenever Microsoft wants it to,
installing new drivers, patches-du-jour and additions, and in the process of
course uninstalling everything that has to go. Apart from doing away
with most of the distribution channel and thereby inflating Microsoft's
revenues as an added bonus, auto-update has enormous possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft will control which drivers are present on our client computers.
    Soon we'll see 'strategic partnerships' emerge between Microsoft and
    peripheral manufacturers, and if we want to connect a printer from a brand
    that competes with one of Microsoft's favored partners we're stuck.</li>
<li>Microsoft controls document compatibility and portability. As part of an
    update, the software may helpfully convert your existing documents and
    files to the new format. Today you may be able to export data to Oracle,
    tomorrow you might be limited to MS SQL.</li>
<li>Exclusive control over the driver and application software will make it
    that much easier to appropriate open standards.</li>
<li>Applications that worked well in 512 megabytes of RAM yesterday suddenly
    need twice that much memory tomorrow.</li>
<li>In order for auto-update to work, Microsoft will need serious access to all
    the files on your harddisk. Of course they'll promise us that that access
    will be limited to the files that make up the operating system... just
    like all the other spyware manufacturers do.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this will be completely automatic. We won't have to worry about it...
meaning that we won't have any control over it. Essentially, the auto-update
feature is a trojan horse. But the beauty of it is that we won't have to
wait until ASP really takes off. In Windows 2000 and XP the first incarnation
of the auto-update feature is already hard at work. And sure enough, the above
concerns have already been proved not to be entirely unjustified.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is Microsoft's announcement that in the future
this service is designed to provide not only automatic updates to Windows,
but also to take care of virus and spyware protection, network security
and other essentials. Of course this service merely lets the user pay
Microsoft to clean up their own rubbish, while there is no reason to
expect it to be any more reliable and secure than is normal practice for
Microsoft. Even more importantly, this all-in-one service is primarily a
vessel for software distribution and control, disguised as a maintenance
process. The software it distributes, through an integrated Windows service,
directly competes with all anti-virus and anti-spyware manufacturers in the
market.</p>

<h3>Update your software, downgrade your rights</h3>
<p>A major advantage of auto-updating (at least from Microsoft's standpoint)
is that it gives them tremendous control over the users' rights and ability
to use their software.</p> 

<p>In June 2002 Microsoft injected a critical security patch for Windows Media
Player into the auto-update channels. The patch itself was harmless enough
(though of course it destroyed RealPlayer's ability to play audio CD's) but
during the automatic installation process the user was quietly required to
agree to a brand new clause in the software End User License Agreement.</p>

<p>This new clause in the EULA gives Microsoft the right to &quot;provide
security related updates to the OS Components that will be automatically
downloaded onto your computer [and] may disable your ability to copy
and/or play Secure Content and use other software on your computer.&quot;
In other words, by installing the patch (which is critical to the security
of your system) you have agreed to give Microsoft deed and title to your
personal property, to disable functions on your computer whenever they feel
like it, and to leave them immune from legal repercussions if they
damage your system, livelihood or worse.</p>

<p>Whenever this happens, Microsoft promises to make a &quot;reasonable
effort&quot; to post notices somewhere on a website. It's clear from their
wording that MS has absolutely no intention of bringing this behavior to
our attention. Instead, Microsoft just assumes the right to surreptitiously
install code of their choosing on your computer. You will not be warned; you
will not be offered an opportunity to examine the download or refuse it. MS
will simply connect remotely and install or disable whatever they will,
or do so secretly when your computer contacts any of their servers.
Microsoft will have administrator privileges on your personal computer.
What they feed you may be infected with viruses; it may break your
applications, corrupt data files, destroy weeks or months or even years of
work, but you'll have no recourse if it does. Their responsibility ends
with &quot;Sorry&quot;.</p>

<p>As if to illustrate that this was more than incidental, a few weeks later
Microsoft released Service Pack 3 for Windows 2000 with a similar clause in
the EULA. This essentially gave Microsoft the right to go into your systems,
gather whatever information they think they need, including an inventory of
what software you're running, and &quot;disclose this information to others,
but not in a form that personally identifies you&quot;. Similar things are
going on with recent updates of Internet Explorer, during the installation of
which you grant Microsoft permission to collect information about OS version
numbers and product identification numbers, IE version number, version numbers
of other software, and Plug-and-Play ID numbers of hardware devices.</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that the Computer Incident Advisory Capability
office (CIAC) has issued an official warning against Windows XP and Office
XP. (CIAC bulletin M-005c.) CIAC officials were displeased with the error
reporting feature in these products. After a crash, Windows and Office XP send
information (i.e. memory dumps) to Microsoft so that developers may do a
'post-mortem' on the data to see what went wrong. These memory snapshots are
likely to contain (possibly sensitive) user data, e.g. the document or
spreadsheet that the user was working on at the time. Microsoft's  promise
that any &quot;accidentally&quot; received sensitive data would not be used in
any way did not impress the CIAC.</p>

<h3>Windows 1984</h3>
<p>All these changes are to a great extent exercises in fixing flaws in
a product you have already bought. But the hidden control features that they
come with are an outrageous imposition for Microsoft to seize more rights
for itself as a condition of those fixes being applied. If you want to keep
your systems working properly, you are forced to give Microsoft control
over your personal and corporate information. Scary? Try 'Orwellian'...</p>

<p>But wait&nbsp;--&nbsp;it gets better. Shortly after announcing their
planned future shift to Internet-based application services, Microsoft
launched a new scheme: Microsoft Passport. This was presented as a
simpler authentication system that would effectively enable us to log
in to the whole planet with one single password. Personal information,
passwords, a virtual identity, credit card information and many other
types of data would be bundled in one system (codename Hailstorm). The
Passport &quot;Wallet&quot; system was the first step in this plan,
and while it was operational it allowed us to log on to all affiliated
websites (including E-commerce sites) with one and the same password. Or
at least, that was the idea.</p>

<p>Apart from the huge security weakness that this single-point
authentication implied, the terms of use left little to the imagination:
you had the right to use the service, period. Microsoft reserved all
other rights, including the right to use the information you provided
as they saw fit, the right to change conditions without notice, and the
right &quot;to exploit any proprietary rights&quot; that you might hold. It
was  interesting to note that they used the word &quot;feedback&quot;
for all user-supplied information (which included each and every
mouseclick). This legally gave them the right to monitor and track
everything you did on the web. In their Passport privacy statement they
stated a commitment (in less than legally airtight terms) to provide
secure user interfaces and transmissions for your data, but little more.
In fact, they explicitly stated that they would &quot;disclose Personal
Information if required to do so by law or <i>in the good-faith belief
that such action is necessary...</i>&quot; In return, they continued
to state that &quot;If Microsoft becomes aware of ongoing site-specific
consumer concerns or problems with Passport participating sites, we
will take these issues seriously...&quot; Well, that should protect our
privacy and legal rights.</p>

<h3>Microsoft and your wallet</h3>
<p>Given Microsoft's penchant for apallingly bad security standards, it
was only a matter of time before the Passport Wallet system would be
cracked and spill its (or rather, your) secrets. And indeed it didn't
take long. Shortly after Passport became operational, credit card
information became available for unauthorized access. Microsoft product
manager spokesman Adam Sohn said there was &quot;no evidence&quot;
that data security was compromised, but the fact that Microsoft took
the entire Passport Wallet service offline until the largest security holes
had been patched up is a fair indication that things just might have
been a little bit more serious. Sohn also stated that Windows XP users
were not affected because of XP's &quot;improved security&quot;. What
he in fact meant was that cross-site scripting is a little harder to
do with XP, and his statement illustrates Microsoft's naive ideas about
security models rather well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Microsoft continued to push Passport. Features in Windows
XP nagged mercilessly, offering all sorts of goodies to get you to divulge
your name, address, age, phone number, and the like, as an incentive.
Then, less than a month after the security breach, Hotmail users were
required to sign up for Passport, and in so doing were added to the
Passport database. Microsoft Messenger suddenly came with compulsory
Passport subscription too.</p>

<p>Then all users who had signed up for Hotmail (or anything else linked
to Passport) before December 2001 got a big surprise. Suddenly Microsoft
quietly changed the rules, and unilaterally decided to pass along
personal information to other companies that used Passport on their
Web sites. This personal information included the user's email address,
birthday, country and zip code, gender and occupation. They did this by
the simple expedient of adding check boxes to the users' personal options
to indicate whether or not data may be shared, and checking those boxes
by default. Microsoft also quietly changed their policy about sharing
your personal Passport information, essentially abandoning most
privacy-related clauses in their earlier policy, and thereby stripping
their Passport customers of all rights to privacy.</p>

<h3>God's own address book</h3>
<p>This was only the beginning. ZDnet's David Coursey, a self-admitted
&quot;non-MS hater&quot;, wrote:</p>

<blockquote><i>
  [Passport] will start simply and helpfully as online services learn to
  interact with your desktop computer. It will become easier to log on:
  A single password will give you access to many more services, and you
  will only enter it once. You'll ask to be notified of events that are
  important to you--and the notification will just appear on your desktop,
  or perhaps on a cell phone or pager. The system will know where you are
  and how to reach you.<br />
  It will link things together that have never been linked before and it
  will seem like magic. Or maybe not. Most of what [Passport] wants to do
  can already be done, but not as flexibly and certainly not on an
  anything-to-anything basis across multiple vendors or systems.<br />
  Think of it as God's address book. To accomplish this ultimate
  linkage, Microsoft will create, perhaps with partners, a giant database
  to collect, manage, and dispense information from what amounts to God's
  address book: Everything you might want to know about everyone will be
  in there.<br />
  Which is to say Microsoft wants to have all your personal information,
  like calendars, contact lists, E-mail inbox, credit card information,
  banking data, and so forth, in this giant database, so that applications
  can use the information to do your bidding. You won't reveal it all
  at once, of course, but as you ask it to do more for you, more will
  be revealed.

<p>Imagine: God's own database... with your private E-mail address, your
private cellphone number, your bank account and credit card numbers,
your financial administration, who your doctor is, what prescription
medication he gave you... This should be good! A database that knows
where you live and what you recently purchased, or whether or not you
have received treatment for any venereal diseases. A database that could
cause possible rejections from your health insurance company because
of genetic defects in your family that you yourself might not even know
about. A database that can tell telemarketeers where and how to reach you
and where to send their unsolicited E-mail. A database that could get
you fired without even knowing why. A database that provides a wealth
of useful details on you including your social security number, age,
occupation, credit record, income...  You name it, it's in there,
maintained by Microsoft and &quot;protected&quot; from the eyes of the
ungodly by the ridiculous kind of security schemes that Microsoft has
become rightly notorious for. Not to mention the US government's
demand for wide open backdoor access into such a database.</p>

<p>Forget Orwell, forget 1984&nbsp;--&nbsp;this is much better!</p>

<p>Eventually the entire Hailstorm project was put on hold. This was
not only in response to widespread criticism concerning security and
the ownership of privacy-sensitive data. The main reason for the holdup
(and fortunately the eventual demise) of the concept was that Microsoft
didn't manage to inspire enough trust in potential implementation
partners. The intended adopters of Hailstorm feared that control over
the accumulated data would enable Microsoft to interpose themselves
between the partners and their customers. Initial negotiations with five
interested companies had already taken place, but even those potential
early adopters <i>couldn't bring themselves to trust Microsoft enough</i>
to do business with them on such a scale.</p>

<p>By the end of 2004 Microsoft was forced to discontinue Passport. In
spite of Microsoft's best marketing efforts and greatest sales pitches,
nobody trusted them enough to participate in, or even pay lip service
to, the Passport initiative. Given the fact that there are generally
partners to be found for just about any venture with Microsoft, and the
fact that at least some decision makers would have based their decision
on Microsoft's track record rather than on sentiment, this should tell
us a thing or two about how bad the state of affairs actually is.</p>

<h3>Microsoft spyware</h3>
<p>Another indication of where Microsoft is going with regard to privacy
breaches is the spyware embedded in Windows Media Player (WMP). Computer
Bytes'
<a href="http://www.computerbytesman.com/">Richard M. Smith</a> explains:</p>

<blockquote><i>
  &quot;Each time a new DVD movie is played on a computer, the WMP software
  contacts a Microsoft Web server to get title and chapter information for the
  DVD. When this contact is made, the Microsoft Web server is given an
  electronic fingerprint which identifies the DVD movie being watched and a
  cookie which uniquely identifies a particular WMP player. With these two
  pieces of information Microsoft can track what DVD movies are being watched
  on a particular computer.&quot;
</i></blockquote>

<p>This nonsense started with Media Player 8, but the Microsoft privacy
policy that came with it did not disclose any of this. Media Player 9
came with even bigger backdoor options for Microsoft. Internet Explorer
7 boasts a &quot;security feature&quot; that contacts a Microsoft server
whenever you access a website. The advertised purpose of this feature is to
protect you from ending up on fraudulent websites. However it has the
additional benefit of informing Microsoft exactly what information on
the Internet you are trying to access, which is the exact definition
of spyware. The Windows XP search assistant also contacts Microsoft
servers on a regular basis for no sufficiently explained reason.</p>  

<p>But not only separate applications have been deliberately compromised.
Windows XP Home Edition regularly connects to a Microsoft server as
well. There are several processes running on all versions of Windows
XP and Vista that generate unexplained network traffic to IP addresses
owned by Microsoft. The US government has a hand in it, too: during an
investigation of Windows by <a href="http://www.cryptonym.com">Cryptonym
Corporation</a>, Chief Scientist Andrew Fernandes discovered a backdoor
for the National Security Agency (NSA) <i>in every flavor of Windows</i>,
from 95 to XP, no matter what country you're in. There is no reason
to assume that this backdoor has been closed in Windows Vista. It is
part of the 'CryptoAPI' code, the foundation of cryptographic security
in Windows. Apart from the question of whether or not the US government
should have backdoors into the cryptography on all Windows computers in
other countries, this means that any backdoor (not to mention other flaws)
in the CryptoAPI module will open up all of Windows to electronic
intrusion.</p>

<h3>Next Generation <strike>Control</strike> Secure Computing</h3>
<p>Where is all this going? Well... Microsoft has taken to putting some
very odd language in some of their updates: things like requiring that
you agree not to benchmark their software, or publish the results
if you do. This should give us pause. And of course there's also
the ridiculous clause in the Office XP EULA that prohibits you from
running it on anything but Windows (without actually mentioning the
words &quot;Linux&quot; or &quot;OSX&quot;). Then, too, XP and Vista
require &quot;activation,&quot; which gives Microsoft some information
about what you're running, and is the first step toward letting them
into your system as a &quot;trusted&quot; associate. Which itself
wouldn't be a big problem if weren't for the fact that activation is
tied to the identity of several hardware components in the computer,
and for Palladium chips and similar hardware being put onto motherboards.
In fact, many hardware manufacturers (including major ones) have been
quietly putting Palladium chips into their motherboards for years.</p>

<p>The Palladium chip runs a system that, when you boot up, decides what
software is trusted and legitimate and thus allowed to run, and what
is forbidden.  After its introduction, Palladium has been renamed into
'Next Generation Secure Computing Base'. Well, that should help. NGSCB,
having attempted to shed the stains of Palladium's negative publicity,
was promised to be released as an integral part of Windows Vista. That
didn't happen, and analists had already warned not to expect any adequate
security and privacy improvements before 2008. So far they have been proven
correct.</p>

<p> Whatever part of NGSCB is going to materialize within the next few years
is more likely to focus on digital rights management and extending control
over the user's desktop than on security. The first thing Palladium (excuse
me, NGSCB) will do is to enable software manufacturers to decide when their
products will run and when not. It will allow them to bind software products
to a single PC, which means that you'll have to get their permission to
replace your hardware. It will allow them to make their software run only for
a certain time, which will enable them to enforce regular payments for
&quot;subscription renewal&quot;. It will enable them to limit or prevent the
making of backups. It will enable them to track versions of products on your
system, link your Internet access to your hardware identity and later to your
own (their infamous and ill-fated Passport system comes to mind) and keep
track of what data you download, use and distribute. Possibly the same can 
be done to hardware in the not-so-distant future. After all there is already
a &quot;feature&quot; in Microsoft's Xbox gaming console, that remotely and
permanently disables it whenever Microsoft's servers detect it has been
tampered with.</p>

<p>In short: control, control and more control. Apparently Microsoft's
definition of 'secure' has more to do with securing their own interests and
extending their control over the user than with actual system security. Their
current plans only extend that control further and further, under the guise of
enhancing security, protecting third party copyrights and working for the
common good.</p>

<p>It's food for thought.</p>
