<h2>8. The road ahead</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;The future is a race between education and
    catastrophe.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Honor where honor's due: Microsoft accomplishments are impressive. Gates
and Allen started with practically nothing in the early seventies, and today
Microsoft is perhaps the most commercially successful company in the world
with a net worth that runs into billions of dollars. Their methods may always
have been doubtful from both a moral and a legal standpoint, but they did
turn inferior products into a commercial success, and a small startup company
into the biggest money-making machine in existence today. This requires
commercial genius, which Gates undeniably has, even though he never really
contributed much to technology or to life in general. Being a great salesman,
he has become perversely rich by selling bad, copycat products. Which only
goes to show that for every rule there's an exception; in this case the
computer industry's old maxim that wealth is a function of creativity and
innovation. Commercial ingenuity will do as well, and Gates' marketing
strategies have been nothing less than brilliant.</p>

<p>Even though the company has done little more than disguise various ideas as
their own, it cannot be denied that Microsoft products have played an
important role in the maturing of the IT industry. Microsoft (in a symbiotic
relationship with chip manufacturer Intel, largely thanks to IBM's decision
to allow third party manufacturers to clone the IBM PC design) has been one
of the factors that made computer technology available to the masses.</p>

<p>When these accomplishments are regarded in their proper perspective, though,
the picture that emerges is less than wonderful.</p>

<h3>Riding the wave</h3>
<p>Microsoft has been credited with being a stimulator of technological
development, and has even been called &quot;the jet engine of the new
economy&quot;. The truth is, however, that corporate ICT investments and
efforts have rarely triggered technological development, but at best
followed up on it. Nuclear research (which lead to a better understanding
of semiconductor materials and ultimately to the modern microchips)
and computer research initially took place as part of the war effort
during the 1940's. The first real electronic computers (Colossus and
ENIAC) were developed at Bletchley Park in the UK and at the Moore
School of Electrical Engineering of Pennsylvania, respectively. Both
were developed on a defense budget. The cold war and America's urge to
outclass the Soviet Union in achievements such as space travel triggered
the founding of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) which developed
much technology, including communications technology and ARPAnet. ARPAnet
eventually matured and grew as other research institutes began to use it,
and ultimately became the Internet. The World Wide Web, powerful as it
is, was simply the next step to its inventor Tim Berners-Lee, who had no
commercial interests in mind and is said to have described his extending
 existing hypercard systems with Internet capability as &quot;a logical,
perhaps even inevitable next step&quot;.</p>

<p>Moore's Law has been in operation for decades: computing power has
roughly doubled every 18 months, while hardware integration has increased
and hardware prices have dropped accordingly. The first cellphones weighed
over 20 pounds, the first GPS receivers filled a desktop. Today we can
buy such devices for a song; they fit into a shirt pocket and perform
much better than those early dinosaurs. Bill Gates claimed that Microsoft
helps keep prices down, saying that modern computing power is &quot;the
equivalent of getting a 747 for the price of a pizza&quot;. The nonsense
of this statement is proven by the fact that similar evolution and price
drops have occurred with technology that Microsoft has nothing to do
with. The reduced price of computing power is merely a reflection of
achievements in the fields of micro-electronics and physics, and of the
simple economics of increased mass production.</p>

<p>Microsoft has ridden the wake (but rarely the crest) of these and other
developments that stimulated technological innovation. They have followed
the trend and capitalized on it, but they haven't driven it noticeably. They
have contributed to making new computer technology available to the masses,
and they created the foundation for today's IT market by turning available
technology into commercially viable products, with great success. But as
is so often the case, the initiator has long since become an impediment
to further progress.</p>

<h3>Two good things...</h3>
<p>We owe Microsoft our gratitude for two (and only two) accomplishments.
Before Microsoft came along, a computer owner could obtain software only from
the manufacturer of that particular computer. If IBM had had it their way
with PC-DOS, this would still have been the case. Microsoft changed that,
first by selling BASIC interpreters to various competing manufacturers of home
computers, later by doing the same with MS-DOS. Their marketing strategy was
instrumental in changing a vertical market (where users buy all their products
from one supplier) to a horizontal market (where many different suppliers
sell components that go into the final end product). Both PC manufacturers
<em>and</em> software manufacturers owe their existence in the PC market
largely to that single fact. Also, by implementing an entry-level user
interface in Windows, they made the PC accessible to the novice user.</p>

<p>These are Good Things, and Microsoft deserves due credit for it. But these
accomplishments were mainly a by-product of Microsoft's marketing strategy.
Their beneficial effects pale next to the damage that Microsoft has done.</p>

<h3>...and countless bad ones</h3>
<p>In today's Microsoft-dominated market, customers aren't served. They are
being <em>used</em>. Microsoft manipulates the market, with the customers as
pawns in their marketing strategies. The needs and wishes of the customers
themselves are completely ignored, unless responding to those needs would help
Microsoft in their rise to complete market domination. And all the while,
Microsoft's marketeers paint this company as the best thing that's ever
happened to us.</p>

<p>Microsoft replaced our dependency on different hardware manufacturers by an
even stronger dependency on one software company (Microsoft) and one platform
(Intel), and the pretty colors of a friendly-looking user interface only hide
the very badly designed technology with which they've saturated the market.
After changing a restrictive vertical computer market into a less restrictive
horizontal one, Microsoft now moves back into a vertical market where all
software products in an otherwise horizontal market are again available from
(or with the consent of) a single supplier. Microsoft has expanded the market
for PC software, but also set the standard for that market: notorious
unreliability, sloppy code, and marketing interests that impede the
introduction of new ideas. The software market is the only market where
products are still accompanied by license agreements that state, often in a few
thousand words that are extremely hard to read, that by using the product
you indemnify the vendor against any claims, losses, or problems it may cause,
even if the vendor knew about the problem before it sold the product. In some
cases you even agree to let Microsoft remotely modify your software and you
can't hold it liable if something breaks as a result. Can you see the an
automobile manufacturer demanding that you sign a waiver before they'll let
you drive one of their cars, in case the brakes don't work? Of course not.
Yet this is considered a normal standard of conduct in the software market,
and while Microsoft is not solely responsible for it, they have contributed
greatly to the blind acceptance of this deterioration of quality standards.
And if you don't like Ford trucks, you can buy a Jeep instead. PC users
generally do not have that option.</p>

<h3>Out of control</h3>
<p>Microsoft has spun out of control, and rules the field of computer
technology and the IT market with an iron fist. Whatever Microsoft's next whim
may be, IT customers <em>must</em> follow it, despite forced upgrades,
replacements of existing software and hardware, huge costs of ownership and
ever-increasing overhead.</p>

<p>Customers in today's IT market no longer have a truly free choice about the
products they want to deploy. It has become all but impossible to run an
office without using Microsoft products. There are so many MS-proprietary
document formats and protocols being used these days that Microsoft products
have become the only game in town. Alternatives are no longer a real
option, because the companies that used to offer them have either been
assimilated or eliminated, and the remaining few are ailing after years of
struggling to cope with proprietary standards designed for incompatibility
with non-MS products.</p>

<h3>The future: more of the same</h3>
<p>And nothing will change. The old saying that &quot;<i>Sony will make more
compact things, Apple will make more beautiful things, Microsoft will make
more money</i>&quot; will hold true as it has done in the past decades.
Microsoft is driven by sales targets, not by quality targets. No matter
how bad their products are, as long as they continue to sell them nobody will
get fired. An sell them they will, by force if necessary.</p>

<p>Microsoft has grown beyond control. Even the DoJ has been unable to come
up with effective measures against the company. This demonstrates that
<em>Microsoft is now effectively above and beyond the law</em>. Microsoft
won't be unhorsed by competition either, because there's virtually no
competition left. They'll just go on as planned, tightening their grip on the
IT market and the user community, continuing to increase our dependency on
their sloppy products, and forcing us to buy useless new releases every other
year or so.</p>

<p>Computer hardware is more powerful than ever, but software efficiency and
reliability have steadily dropped. PC programmers no longer know any serious
quality standards for software development, users still don't do their work
any faster or any more efficiently, and therapists are now treating something
they call 'Technology Related Anger'.</p>

<p>And we're stuck with all this. That's the whole point: because of Microsoft,
we're stuck with Microsoft. In fact we're stuck not only with Microsoft, but
also (and especially) with what Microsoft has done to the ICT market. Even if
Microsoft would cease to exist today, the PC software market would need years
to recover from the huge impediment to innovation that Microsoft has become.</p>

<h3>The damage has been done</h3>
<p>For years and years Microsoft has stunted the true growth of
computer technology under the guise of innovation. In the early years the PC
and LAN market was driven by innovation that resulted directly in enhanced
productivity. Simple products like DOS and DOS-based applications, even with
all their limitations and drawbacks, achieved dramatic boosts in productivity.
End users could streamline their business processes with batch files, macros
and other forms of scripting, and applications were mostly limited to features
that made sense. In those days the investments in automation usually paid off
directly in the form of enhanced productivity. But as Windows began to
dominate the market this tendency changed, and was ultimately replaced by
exploding costs without any further increase in productivity.</p>

<p>Nowadays most desktop tasks actually take longer than they used to ten
years ago. Most office applications such as Word and Excel lack features that
users would like to have (such as simple macro's and scripting, control over
markup codes and freely interchangeable documents) but eat up a lot of
production time while users try to find their way through the maze of added
bells and whistles and an inconsistent and unergonomic user interface. Windows
is designed to be operated manually; the use of scripting and macro-based
jobs is no longer possible.</p>

<h3>What we need... but won't get</h3>
<p>Ideally Windows should be replaced with an OS built around a
robust kernel (the Unix approach comes to mind) but with the focus on
user-friendliness that has been one of the deciding factors in Windows'
popularity. Open API's and toolkits would let application developers
create products with a uniform look and feel to the user interface.
This could certainly be done with the technology available today. There
are a lot of players in the software market who would be eminently capable
of such an effort. But nobody in his right mind would invest in such a
project, because commercial success requires displacing Microsoft from
over 95% of the world's personal computers.  The inertia of the market
alone guarantees that such a transition will take at least five and maybe
as much as ten years, and that's not counting Microsoft's sabotaging
such efforts.</p>

<p>Some readers have taken this paper as an advocacy for Linux, MacOS or other
products. While those would indeed be better alternatives from a technical
point of view, one should not be blind to the fact that for most of us these
are not viable alternatives. In order to make our living, we're expected
--even forced-- to be compatible with the one brand of products that has been
deliberately made incompatible with almost everything else.</p>

<p>Several readers have pointed out that recently OSX has become a more and
more realistic alternative, now that Apple has begun to sell computers based
on Intel processors. In fact OSX has been made to run succesfully on standard
PCs. However these experiments involve illegal versions of OSX, which then
have to be massaged and occasionally reverse-engineered (all in violation
of the applicable licensing conditions) to make them work. But the point
here is not that OSX can now be made to run on a PC, at least from a technical
standpoint. The main thing is that Apple is not doing it. If there's anyone
who can release such a product and make it popular, it's Apple. But no such
product is apparently forthcoming.</p>

<p>At the same time, more and more readers of this paper are wondering
what Google is up to. Notwithstanding widespread concerns that Google is
getting more and more powerful and could become the next Evil Empire, the
fact is that Google is gearing up for something major. They're building
humungous datacenters, the locations of which are largely governed by how
many Gigawatts of electricity are locally available. That should tell us a
few things about Google's visions of the future. Google undeniably packs a
punch, and could certainly release, say, a $40 operating system based on a
Linux or BSD kernel, and get OEMs to sell it with name recognition. People
would definitely buy it. However, again the point is that Google has
not done that, and appears to have no plans whatsoever of venturing into
that particular market. Google focuses on information providing, online
advertising and online application services, which makes sense because 
that is what they're good at. They're not into operating systems and
application software.</p>

<p>So it doesn't look like a change is in the winds anytime soon.</p>

<h3>And that is why</h3>
<p>Microsoft has stunted the true growth of computer technology under the
guise of innovation. They have manipulated technology in order to force
their customers to turn to Microsoft as a sole supplier. They have driven up
the cost of computing in order to spike their own revenues, and behaved in
ways that show contempt for their customers and the law. They have shown a
tendency towards lying and general dishonesty. And with a towering display
of hypocrisy they keep telling us that everything they have done has only
been in response to public demand for innovation and to the needs of the IT
professional.</p>

<p><i>That</i> is why I hate Microsoft. Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question. And the answer is &quot;No&quot;.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates, Mr. Ballmer, I've upped my standards... so up yours.</p>
