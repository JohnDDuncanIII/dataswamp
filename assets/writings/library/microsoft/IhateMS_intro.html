	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p align="right"><i>&quot;One OS to bring them all
			and in the darkness bind them...&quot;</i></p>

	<p class="first">From the title of this paper you may have guessed that I am
		not very impressed with the guys in Redmond. One might even say that my
		dislike for Microsoft is a pet hate gone out of control in an almost quixotic
		fashion. Why is this?</p>

	<p>Of course I have been accused of personal antipathy, of being jealous of
		Bill Gates and his billions, and of being prejudiced against all things
		Microsoft without any reason whatsoever. None of this is true. I have
		nothing personal against Bill Gates. Why should I? I don't know the man,
		I've never met him. I agree with those who say he might be the most successful
		salesman in history. And I've always thought that even one billion in almost
		any currency is more than I could reasonably spend.</p>

	<p>No. It's rather his business practices, and that of his company,
		that I am opposed to, for a large and still growing number of reasons,
		most of which are plain, verifiable facts.<br />
		This paper explains <i>why</i> Microsoft is bad for us.</p>
