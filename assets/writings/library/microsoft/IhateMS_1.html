				Gates and Allen, ca. 1968
	</td></tr></table>

	<p>In 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen, who were students at Harvard University
		at the time, adapted BASIC to run on the popular Altair 8800 computer and
		sold it to the Altair's manufacturer, MITS. Although BASIC had been invented
		by others in 1964, the Altair BASIC interpreter was the first computer
		language program to run on the type of computer that would later become
		known as the home computer. While the BASIC programming language itself was
		already in the public domain by then, there was no interpreter that could
		run it on the first microcomputers, and the small microprocessor systems
		typically developed by hobbyists and researchers were still being programmed
		in machine code and often operated via switches.</p>

	<p>Thus Gates and Allen could be said to have created an original product. One
		might even call it a true innovation.</p>

	<p>It would be one of their last.</p>

	<h3>Developing BASIC on borrowed time</h3>
	<p>Gates and Allen initially met at Lakeside School (an exclusive private
		school for rich boys) where Gates became an adept at BASIC on a General
		Electric Mark II computer. Shortly thereafter they got access to a PDP-10
		run by a private company in Seattle. The company offered free time to the
		Lakeside school kids to see if they could crash the system. Gates proved
		to be particularly good at doing so. When the free time ran out, Gates and
		Allen figured out how to continue using the PDP-10 by logging on as the
		system operator. About a year later the company that owned the PDP-10 went
		bankrupt.</p>

	<p>This left Gates and Allen without a source of unpaid computing resources.
		Therefore Allen went over to the University of Washington and began using a
		Xerox computer by pretending to be a graduate student. Gates soon followed,
		and this went on until they were caught and removed from the campus. They
		continued to break into university and privately owned computer systems until
		about 1975. By that time Gates was a student at Harvard University, and HP
		had been selling the 9830 calculator (an expensive system for scientific and
		industrial math applications) for three years. The 9830 had a BASIC
		interpreter, which opened up a whole new range of applications outside the
		field of mathematical calculation. Whether or not Gates and Allen had actually
		seen a 9830 before they coded up their BASIC interpreter for the Altair is not
		known, but it is quite possible.</p>

	<p>In any case, the BASIC that Gates sold to MITS had been developed and
		tested on a PDP-10 computer owned by Harvard, using an 8080-emulation
		program that Allen had adapted from earlier code. In fact, by the time
		Gates contacted MITS to announce their product, it had never seen an
		actual 8080 CPU. The demonstration Gates and Allen put up for MITS in New
		Mexico was the first time the product actually ran on the system it was
		intended for. Gates sold it by announcing a product that didn't exist,
		developing it on the model of the best version available elsewhere,
		not testing it very seriously, demonstrating an edition that didn't
		fully work, and finally releasing the product in rather buggy form after
		a lengthy delay. From then on this modus operandi became Microsoft's
		trademark.</p>

	<h3>The controversy begins</h3>
	<p>After Gates sold the 8800 BASIC interpreter to MITS he left Harvard
		University, and went into business for himself with Allen as a partner. Allen
		was also an MITS employee at the time, which made his position somewhat
		questionable.<br />
		Gates' departure from Harvard appears to be somewhat controversial. Some say
		he dropped out, others say he was expelled for stealing computer time. Whatever
		the case may be, the fact is that Gates did most of the work on his BASIC
		version in a Harvard computer lab <i>without having been authorized to use
			the computing resources for the project</i>. Perhaps he did not really steal
		unauthorized computer capacity, which was a limited and expensive commodity
		in those days, to develop his first commercially successful product. Yet he
		has never offered any other explanation. He did however send his now-infamous
		&quot;Open Letter To Hobbyists&quot; to every major computer publication in
		February 1976, in which he decried the copying of commerical software
		(especially Altair BASIC) by home computer hobbyists as simple theft. He
		also claimed to have spent $40,000 in computer time developing BASIC, but
		neglected to mention where that computer time came from.</p>

	<p>Be that as it may... Gates <em>was</em> brilliant enough at the time
		to realize that he was sitting on a goldmine. While MITS demanded, and
		got, the exclusive rights to the software, Gates insisted on a clause in the
		contract where MITS agreed to &quot;commercialize the product&quot;. These
		&quot;best efforts&quot; never panned out and Microsoft's income began
		to dry up. In 1977 Gates and Allen sent a letter of protest to MITS,
		whereupon MITS got a judge to restrain Microsoft from disclosing 8080
		BASIC code to any third party. Microsoft was saved from bankruptcy
		only by payments for the 6502 BASIC from Apple Computer. (MITS only
		had the rights to 8080 BASIC, so Microsoft was allowed to port it to
		other CPU architectures and sell it all over again.) Then Microsoft
		sued their first customer MITS over the exclusive rights on 8080 BASIC,
		and won. They immediately went on to sell BASIC over and over again,
		to any other hardware manufacturer who would have it, from Commodore
		in Europe to Radio Shack in the US. Thus Gates' vision was one of the
		important factors in the creation of the home computer market of the
		late 1970's and early 1980's. (The other was the increasing availability
		of affordable VLSI computer chips.)</p>

	<h3>Microsoft <strike>develops</strike> buys MS-DOS</h3>
	<p>It went more or less the same when IBM came to Microsoft in 1980,
		for an operating system (OS) for their &quot;Project Chess&quot; which
		we now know as the development of IBM's new Personal Computer. Microsoft
		was still a small-scale operation in those days, making mostly software
		for the hobby and home computer market, and a few computer language
		products. IBM had another preferred supplier at the time: they went to
		Digital Research to discuss their needs for an OS for their upcoming
		PC. Gary Kildall, the founder of Digital Research, was the author of
		CP/M, the first operating system for microcomputers. This made Digital
		Research, and not Microsoft, the logical first choice for IBM, as CP/M
		would have fit their requirements. However, common lore has it that
		Kildall wasn't in Pebble Beach the day the IBM representatives arrived
		there for their appointment, and his wife and lawyer wouldn't sign the
		non-disclosure agreement until Kildall had returned. (That mistake has
		gone on record as perhaps the most capital blunder in the entire history
		of the PC industry.)</p>

	<p>This, and time restrictions, led up to IBM's visit to Gates and
		his friends who, as rumor has it, were in the picture only because
		Gates' mother happened to know someone at IBM. This last detail may
		or may not be true; in any case it's a fact that Microsoft was a small
		company without management, without much administration or bookkeeping,
		with employees who slept on the floor behind their keyboards, and with
		a corporate culture based on shouting matches that were usually won by
		Gates. Microsoft had only worked on home computer software and programming
		languages at the time, and was <i>not</i> a supplier of operating systems
		or other system software. (Kildall himself has later added to this story
		that he did manage to contact the IBM representatives upon his return,
		discussed the deal with them, and was left with the impression that he
		had an agreement with IBM. Shortly thereafter he learned that IBM had
		signed contracts with Microsoft. This may or may not be true, but in
		any case it's hardly relevant here.)</p>

	<p>When the IBM representatives showed up on his doorstep, Gates
		recognized this lucky break for what it was, and promised them an
		OS. Because he didn't have one and couldn't make one (at least not well
		enough and quickly enough) he bought the rights to a CP/M clone named
		QDOS from Seattle Computing Products, and filed off the serial numbers.
		Again Gates demonstrated his commercial genius at that point. He realized
		that although the PC was far from superior from a technological standpoint,
		IBM's position as a hardware manufacturer would go a long way to unifying
		the personal computer market, which had always been rather fragmented.
		Gates saw visions of minor investments resulting in huge sales figures.
		Innovation did not come into it at all; at the time the world's
		buildings, bridges and aeroplanes were mostly developed on VAX
		and Unix workstations.</p>

	<p>So when IBM demanded exclusive rights to PC-DOS, Gates was adamant: 
		IBM was prohibited from licensing Microsoft's software to third parties, but
		Microsoft itself was free to do so. Microsoft would sell MS-DOS to all
		interested clone manufacturers, just as they did with BASIC when MITS lost
		their exclusive rights. Thereby Gates created most of the basis for the PC
		market as we know it today.</p>

	<h3>A changing market</h3>
	<p><em>This</em> is Microsoft's contribution to the field of computer
		technology: before they sold BASIC and later DOS to any hardware vendor
		who would buy it, end users were completely dependent on a hardware
		manufacturer not only for hardware, but also for platform-specific operating
		systems and application software. Microsoft's marketing strategy put an end
		to that, and contributed to changing the vertical computer market into a
		horizontal one. For that the company deserves due credit.</p>

	<p>But that is all. Microsoft applied the right leverage at the right
		time, and the market's natural inertia did the rest. The IBM PC happened
		to be based on an Intel 8086 processor. The CP/M-descended products now
		sold by Microsoft standardized on the 80x86 processor architecture and
		weren't portable to other platforms.  That in turn caused Intel to
		continue the 80x86-based architecture. This symbiotic relationship
		popularly known as Wintel still continues today.</p>

	<h3>The demise of innovation</h3>
	<p>While Microsoft was the first to market (but not create) a more-or-less
		functional operating system for the IBM-PC platform, the company has
		never originated any significant technological improvement since Altair
		BASIC. At best they've modified and adapted existing technology, but
		nothing original or particularly innovative has been created by Microsoft
		ever since. The first version of PC-DOS (later MS-DOS) was little more
		than a revamped version of QDOS (or DOS-86), the code for which they
		bought from Seattle Computing Products (SCP). QDOS, which stands for
		&quot;Quick &amp; Dirty Operating System&quot;, was the work of Tim
		Paterson, a friend of Paul Allen's. It was derived (to such an extent
		that it has been called pirated) from CP/M. After its initial release
		numerous features, including suspiciously Unix-like but rather broken
		support for subdirectories, I/O redirection and pipelines, were hacked
		into Microsoft's subsequent versions of MS-DOS. This resulted in two
		or more incompatible versions of many system calls in the DOS kernel,
		and MS-DOS programmers could never agree on basic things like what
		character to use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive,
		or what file descriptor to use. Not much has changed in the twenty years
		that followed. When WIndows ME came out in 2000, all you had to do was
		look under the hood and the QDOS and CP/M legacies from elder days
		would stare you in the face.</p>

	<p>As an interesting aside, while Gary Kildall had worked on CP/M for
		years, Tim Paterson of SCP compiled QDOS in under 6 weeks. He left SCP
		in 1981 and joined his friend Paul Allen at Microsoft. Later Kildall
		allegedly went to IBM and pointed out where his own copyright statement
		was still embedded in PC-DOS, but he did not dare fight it out with
		the full force of IBM's legal division.  To forestall legal action, IBM
		offered consumers the choice of either CP/M or MS-DOS. But at $240, six
		times the price of MS-DOS, CP/M was quickly headed for extinction.<br />
		Kildall's allegations of theft by SCP, and the fact that the differences
		between QDOS and CP/M are minute at best, can't have escaped Microsoft's
		attention at the time. This leads to the interesting conclusion that <i>if</i>
		this is true, then Microsoft and IBM knowingly acted as fences, and Microsoft
		founded a global empire on a crime.</p>

	<h3>The market lock-in</h3>

	</td></tr></table>
	<p>In any case MS-DOS thrived. It remained the only PC operating system on the
		market for years, in spite of the fact that it was rather restrictive. In fact
		the restrictions it imposed upon the application developers prolonged its
		success: few developers were really happy with it, but they were stuck with
		it. MS-DOS offered way too little functionality, so that application builders
		were forced to make their application code carry out tasks that should have
		been performed by the OS. Some early applications (such as Lotus-123 and,
		more commonly, computer games) bypassed DOS entirely. In other products most
		peripheral access, video and printer communications (I/O) had to be done by
		having the application access the hardware directly in order to get a decent
		performance. Users had to know (and remember) the 's I/O port addresses, IRQ
		numbers and DMA channel settings for each hardware component when installing
		and configuring applications.</p>

	<p>This lack of proper OS functions in MS-DOS resulted in application software
		less portable than the Rocky Mountains, which effectively forced software
		developers to stick with the MS-DOS platform in order to maintain their
		applications and protect their investments. DOS itself was non-portable as
		well, being largely written in Assembly language and containing a lot of
		low-level code and little structure. I've personally seen the DOS 6 source
		code. It's not a pretty sight.</p>

	<h3>Gates: don't develop, copy</h3>
	<p>By the time PC-DOS took hold, Gates had already shown that Microsoft's
		future would hold very little innovation indeed. Gates' views on development
		are probably best illustrated by the following:</p>

	<blockquote><i>
			From: 'Programmers at work', Microsoft Press, Redmond, WA [1986]:<br />
			Interviewer: &quot;Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to
			be a programmer?&quot;<br />
			Gates: &quot;No, the best way to prepare is to write programs, and to study
			great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the
			garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of
			their operating system.&quot;
	</i></blockquote>

	<p>Seldom have both Microsoft's lack of innovation <em>and</em> their kludgy,
		ad-hoc approach to software design been explained so concisely. It's also
		interesting to note that while many people have called Microsoft products
		copycat, trash or garbage, most of them probably had no idea how close to the
		truth they really were.</p>

	<p>Indeed MS-DOS has seen little innovation in the two decades or so when it
		dominated the PC market. The most important improvement in DOS 2.0 was the
		addition of subdirectories and device drivers, ideas that were borrowed from
		Unix. Later versions came with a few extra functions in the kernel, and they
		boasted more tools and utility programs, initially written by Microsoft
		but later bought from third parties. Except for the additions in DOS 2
		(subdirectories, device drivers) and DOS 5 (extended and enhanced memory
		management on 80286 and 80386 CPU's based on technology from Quarterdeck)
		DOS itself has only seen minor development. In the meantime Microsoft briefly
		sold Xenix (a rather unimpressive Unix port for the PC, which they bought
		outright from SCO) but when it failed to sell in huge volumes they soon
		lost interest and concentrated on DOS.</p>

	<h3>The Windows coup</h3>
	<p>When Windows came into existence, Microsoft had been collaborating with IBM
		on OS/2 1.x for some time. This collaboration sprung from the insight that
		with the advent of the 80286 CPU and Intel's plans for the 80386, DOS had
		become obsolete. IBM worked mainly on the OS/2 kernel, which in its first
		incarnation was basically a 16-bit successor to DOS with a command line
		interface. Microsoft concentrated on the Graphic User Interface (GUI).</p> 

	<p>The idea for a Graphic User Interface was neither new nor original. Years
		before, Xerox had demonstrated a mouse-controlled GUI in their Palo Alto
		Research Center. This demonstration featured the Alto computer, which in
		1973 sported a GUI, a mouse, graphic WYSIWYG technology and an Ethernet
		network interface. The demo was attended by Steve Jobs (Apple) and Bill
		Gates, among others. Jobs saw the possibilities of the GUI and went on to
		implement the idea into Apple's OS and application software, while Gates
		decided to stay with the text-based user interface. Later Gates was forced
		to revise his opinion about the GUI when it turned out to be successful
		on the Apple platform. Thus it was decided that OS/2 would have a GUI.</p>

	<p>Soon Microsoft's code began to diverge from IBM's (especially from
		Presentation Manager, IBM's GUI component of OS/2) and became increasingly
		incompatible with it. Meanwhile
		Gary Kildall of Digital Research had already released the first version of
		GEM, a Graphic Environment Manager for DOS. In order to sabotage this,
		Microsoft announced that they were working on their own, much better, graphic
		environment. Eventually they took the GUI portion of what should have become
		OS/2 and sold it as a separate DOS product called MS-Windows. In its initial
		form it was mainly text based and hardly useful, but they claimed to work
		on it in preparation for the upcoming OS/2. In the meantime, application
		developers (e.g. Word Perfect Corp., Ashton-Tate and Lotus) spent huge
		R&amp;D budgets on rewriting their applications for OS/2, assuming that the
		IBM/Microsoft partnership would deliver as promised.</p>

	<p>MS-Windows could have been a new start, but (mainly for strategic and
		marketing reasons) it wasn't. It tightly clung to the mistakes of the past,
		being based upon the underlying MS-DOS architecture for basic OS functions
		such as file system access. It added a simple cooperative multitasker to
		MS-DOS, in a manner strangely like that of DesqView (a multitasker for DOS
		that had been available from Quarterdeck for years). It also sported a GUI
		that was so close to the one used by Apple that it kept lawyers occupied for
		over half a decade. But as far as innovation was concerned, that was it.</p>

	<p>Initial versions of Windows were very bad, but Microsoft kept promising
		that a better product would come out Real Soon Now, still as part of their
		joint OS/2 efforts with IBM. Until one day, that is, when suddenly they
		turned their backs on OS/2. They cried &quot;innovation&quot; and
		went back to DOS in spite of earlier having admitted it to be
		obsolete. Then they went and dropped out of the collaboration with IBM
		entirely, taking with them a lot of IBM technology that had ended up in
		Windows, which they now suddenly positioned as the operating system
		of the future. They never even mentioned their earlier promises about OS/2
		again.</p>

	<h3>Hijacking the applications market</h3>
	<p>Microsoft already sold applications for the Apple Macintosh. This gave
		them a good look under the hood of Apple's operating system software, and
		enabled them to muscle Apple into granting them a license for portions of
		the MacUI. (They threatened to withdraw all Mac applications, unless Apple
		would grant them a license to use MacUI code to port Macintosh apps to the
		PC.) They then raided MacUI for extra ideas. The remaining few bits (e.g.
		the font technology they later called TrueType) they bought, occasionally
		bartering vaporware that later failed to materialize. They also threw in
		a random collection of small applications, completely unrelated to an operating
		system (e.g. Paintbrush) which they had bought from various sources to flesh
		things out a bit. The resulting mixed bag of bits and pieces was massaged
		into an end product and released as Windows 3.0.</p>

	<p> It was not too difficult for Microsoft to adapt the Apple versions of Word
		and Excel to run on Windows 3. There is some indication that Windows was
		adapted to Word and Excel as much as Word and Excel were adapted to Windows.
		By the time Windows 3.0 hit the market, competing application developers had
		already put their R&amp;D money into OS/2 versions of their products, on
		the assumption that OS/2 would be delivered as promised by the IBM/Microsoft
		partnership. And now OS/2 did not materialize. But a blown R&amp;D budget was
		only half the problem. Even if most of the application manufacturers had been
		wealthy enough to fund two separate development efforts to upgrade their DOS
		products, there was not enough time to do the Windows version before Windows'
		projected release date. The fact that the Windows API had not been
		published in any permanent form yet didn't help either. Without a good
		Application Program Interface (API) specification, an application developer
		is not able to interface with the operating system or with other software
		products. This essentially prevents application development. And Microsoft
		was the only application vendor at the time who knew enough about the Windows
		API to come up with a market-ready product.</p>

	<p>So Microsoft shipped both an OS <i>and</i> an application suite, several
		months before their competitors in the applications market had a chance to
		catch up with Microsoft's last-moment switch to Windows. And that was that.
		All those who had expected to sail with the IBM/Microsoft alliance missed
		the boat, when Microsoft suddenly and deliberately decided to cast off
		earlier and in another direction than they had originally promised.
		Most of the independent application vendors never recovered.</p>

	<h3>The demise of OS/2</h3>
	<p>IBM eventually went on to release their own version of OS/2, and botched it
		completely. This is partially due to the fact that by the time OS/2 hit the
		market, that market had already been taken away from them by Microsoft,
		especially because most application developers had committed themselves to
		Windows by then. They used Windows development tools, so their code had
		become extremely hard to port to another OS. Native OS/2 application software
		remained scarce, and hardware support was even a bigger problem.</p>

	<p>Even so, IBM remains responsible for much of the demise of OS/2. Although
		it had an infinitely better architecture than Windows, OS/2 was killed off
		by some of the worst strategic and marketing decisions in the history of the
		industry. Its brief and unhappy existence was marked by a lack of drivers and
		hardware support, a lack of development tools, and a lack of applications.
		In typical IBM fashion the end user was expected to manually edit a 4-page
		CONFIG.SYS file to configure the system. Partnerships with hardware vendors
		to ship OS/2 with systems that didn't have the power to run it properly made
		the problem even worse. Lack of good marketing drove the final nail into
		OS/2's coffin.</p>

	<p>After this debacle IBM withdrew from the desktop software market which
		they had never really understood, in spite of having created the original
		IBM PC.</p>

	<h3>The non-innovation continues</h3>
	<p>Creating a better software platform would have been a real innovation, but
		that would have meant to abandon DOS, which was all that Microsoft had at the
		time. Since DOS applications were practically non-portable, a new and better
		OS would have broken the ties that bound developers (and therefore users) to
		Microsoft. In order to maintain their market share, Microsoft chose not to
		innovate. So for reasons of marketing, Windows 3.x ran on top of DOS as
		little more than a hybrid multitasking shell.</p>

	<p>The Windows 95 architecture was merely a continuation of Microsoft's
		uninnovative strategy. When Windows 95 was released no less than three years
		later (Windows 93 was planned but never made it) it still turned out to be
		a disappointing rehashed DOS-based product. It still ran on top of DOS as an
		application-level shell, although DOS and Windows were now installed from a
		single bundle rather than as separate products. Basically Windows 95 was
		nothing but plain old Windows 3.x with a new GUI and a souped-up memory
		manager, and the formerly separate DOS code integrated in the bundle. This
		did not stop Microsoft from marketing it as a completely new 32-bit OS,
		which of course it wasn't. Granted, portions of the code were 32-bit,
		but there was still a lot of 16-bit code running under the hood, and
		memory protection was partially functional at best. Windows 95 and its
		successors still relied heavily on obsolete DOS code. Windows 98 (Windows
		'97 was planned but again never made it) was not a significant improvement
		in this respect either, and Windows ME was just more of the same tired old
		stuff, plus a lot of new bugs. It was still DOS-based, although Microsoft
		had gone to great pains to hide that fact, through many cosmetic
		changes and the bundling of application software with the OS. Basically
		there's nothing new to the whole Windows 95/98/ME product line; most design
		flaws from previous Windows versions right back to 3.0 are still present,
		and many new flaws have been introduced. When you get right down to it,
		Windows ME wasn't much more than the repackaged Windows 3.x descendant that
		Windows 95 was, full of architectural ineptitude and based upon technology
		that has been obsolete for decades, with a lot of extra bells and whistles
		thrown in to confuse the issue.</p>

	<p>None of this has stopped Microsoft from presenting all these minor updates
		as new products and pushing them as recommended upgrades.</p>

	<blockquote><i>

	<h3>NT: Not-so-new Technology</h3>
	<p>Windows NT finally appeared to be a step in the right direction. At
		least the NT product line (which includes Windows 2000, XP and Vista)
		is the better one. 'NT' stands for 'New Technology', presumably because
		Windows NT is one of the few keystone products in the history of Microsoft
		that they didn't buy outright.  Instead they hired David Cutler, who had
		played an important role in the development of VMS at DEC (Digital Equipment
		Corporation). VMS was a successful and innovative industrial OS in its days,
		and Digital had been working on it since the 1970's. Cutler took some 20
		former Digital employees with him, and he and his team began the development
		of NT. The project eventually involved hundreds of other coders and
		testers, but Cutler and his core team of VMS engineers provided most of
		the know-how that went into NT's kernel code.</p>

	<p>As a result, many design principles found in the VMS kernel ended up in
		Windows NT. (The number and splitting of priority levels in the scheduler, the
		use of demand-paged virtual memory and the layered driver model are only a few
		examples of many, many similarities.) The first version of VMS was released in
		1977. Without trivializing the efforts of Cutler and his team (they <i>did</i>
		a lot of work on the project) one has to wonder what Microsoft really means
		with &quot;New Technology&quot;. To illustrate, in a little known out-of-court
		settlement Microsoft paid DEC $150 million in compensation for using portions
		of old Digital OS code in Windows NT.</p>

	<p>Ehm... <i>New</i> Technology...??</p>

	<h3>Marketing prevails over engineering</h3>
	<p>Even though its roots go back to the 1970's, the Windows NT product line is
		a big improvement over Microsoft's DOS-based products. Unfortunately that
		doesn't automatically mean that it's a well-designed operating system.</p>

	<p>Cutler's team had to operate within Microsoft's additional design
		restrictions, and the result was a tradeoff. Cutler took a number of design
		principles from VMS, which was good. They expanded on that, so in a way NT can
		be said to contain at least <i>some</i> &quot;New Technology&quot; and perhaps
		Cutler's work even represented (dare I say it?) some innovation, in that it
		brought robust design principles to the IBM PC platform. Had that been all, the
		end result could have been a good, efficient and robust OS. But Gates needed a
		vehicle that  would further Microsoft's marketing strategies, rather than a
		robust OS. And of course much of the eventual coding on NT was done by
		Microsoft engineers, so in the end the quality of NT's final code wasn't even
		in the same league as VMS.</p>

	<p>VMS was an industrial-strength operating system with native clustering, but
		NT was to be a single-user desktop operating system. Account and data
		management were rudimentary; the user home directory resided on the
		workstation's local harddisk, under the subdirectory that held the bulk
		of the operating system code. Applications and user settings were
		system-based rather than account-based. Separation between OS code, user
		settings, application code and configuration data became all but impossible;
		application and GUI settings were stored along with vital operating system
		information in an insecure central registry that was also system-based.
		Therefore network-based user accounts could only be implemented with complex
		and cumbersome workarounds. One of the biggest design mistakes in the history
		of Windows (the design of the DLL subsystem) was perpetuated, and networking
		was initially based on the hopelessly inadequate NetBEUI protocol. Even though
		NT followed a peer-to-peer networking model, a separate &quot;NT Server&quot;
		version was shipped. (NT Server contained exactly the same code as NT
		Workstation, with a few additions that amount to only a fraction of the
		product's total code set.) Initially there had been intentions of portability
		to non-Intel hardware, the incorporation of a Hardware Abstraction Layer,
		and versions of Windows NT on Digital and other platforms, but as the market
		became more and more monolithic these good intentions fell by the wayside.
		Eventually Digital did the same.</p>

	<p>So at the end of the day Microsoft's marketing prevailed over Cutler's
		engineering. The result wasn't pretty. NT became an OS based on a set of old
		VMS design principles that were made compatible with everything that Microsoft
		had ever done wrong. It was full of legacy API's, it was kludged up to run
		applications written for OS/2 1.0 (but not very well), it paid lip service
		to POSIX but never offered anything more than fractional POSIX compliance,
		and it sported a Windows&nbsp;3 GUI that had its roots in both Apple's
		and IBM's user interfaces. It even contained the entire Windows&nbsp;3
		kernel and the bulk of its accompanying code (and Windows XP still does) in
		the original 16-bit executables, as well as the complete set of decades-old
		DOS code. In short, it was a real Microsoft product. All later versions of
		Windows that descended from this piece of &quot;New Technology&quot;, right up
		to Windows Vista, suffer from this legacy.</p>

	<p>Sic transit gloria Fenestrae.</p>

	<h3>Consolidation rather than innovation</h3>
	<p>It's rather ironic that Microsoft prides itself on their &quot;innovative
		role&quot; in the IT market. The sad truth is that Microsoft has rarely been
		an innovator. They purchased a CP/M ripoff and named it MS-DOS, and they
		cobbled Windows together from various bits and pieces that they bought, stole
		or borrowed. The graphic user interface for Windows was based on IBM know-how
		and the user interface of the Apple Macintosh, which was in turn derived from
		technology developed by Xerox ages ago. NT was based on good but old VAX VMS
		design principles. In short, all Microsoft OS products only implement features
		and ideas that have been around for as much as a quarter of a century.</p>

	<p>Later versions of Windows contain no significant improvement over previous
		versions. Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP and Vista are in fact 'point releases';
		they're relatively minor updates that contain mostly fixes, new bugs, and a
		few small extras that used to be sold separately but are now bundled into the
		package. For example: Windows XP comes with application software for scanners
		and digital cameras, or the &quot;remote desktop&quot; feature that was
		formerly sold separately by Citrix. The rest is little but cosmetics. The
		whole product line remains riddled with serious design flaws, kludgy code to
		work around those flaws, and tons of bugs. There's been little reason to switch
		from Windows 95 to 98 (except perhaps the discontinuation of support and
		maintenance on '95) and none at all to switch to ME. Windows 2000, XP and
		Vista contain mostly bug fixes and work-arounds. Neither 2000 nor XP or Vista
		offered a proper Return On Investment to users of previous versions, and
		there's little or no demand for any of the extras that come with them.
		In fact in August 2005 a significant percentage of Windows services was still
		based on NT4, while Windows 2000 was still the most common version on the
		desktop. Especially the latter was interesting, as Microsoft had discontinued
		support for this version by then. Windows XP was around for about five years
		and by the end of that period had become the most common version, but few
		XP users have found reason to upgrade to Vista.<br />
		Nevertheless Bill Gates called Windows XP &quot;a very big thing&quot; and
		Steve Ballmer said that &quot;Windows XP is a more significant advance forward
		than anything since Windows 3.0&quot;. Microsoft's rhetoric on Vista was even
		more unrealistic.</p>

	<h3>A better Windows? Or just better marketing?</h3>
	<p>Windows XP was the next version of the Windows NT/2000 product line,
		but it was marketed as a replacement for Window 9x/ME. By default it
		sports a seriously dumbed-down user interface. This insulting toy box,
		apparently aimed at users aged 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;4 and technophobes who are
		scared off even by Macintosh desktops, can fortunately be overridden but
		is always installed by default. Under the hood XP has a Windows-2000
		kernel. There are a few slight improvements to the kernel code, but
		nothing dramatic. Of course there is also a lot of additional application
		software bundled with it, especially third-party multimedia products
		that MS bought and re-branded.</p>

	<p>XP's release was timed to coincide with the discontinuation of
		the 9x/ME line, as part of Microsoft's repositioning of their Windows
		product lines. Through this admittedly clever marketing trick, end
		users were encouraged to compare XP with Windows 9x/ME and think of it
		as a new product, which was of course rather misleading. XP was just an
		overpriced point update of Windows 2000 and nothing more.</p>

	<p>Incidentally, 'XP' stands for 'eXPerience'. Apparently Microsoft
		thinks we need a new 'experience' with our operating systems and
		applications, and that we sit at our computers expecting to be
		entertained by OS features and a spreadsheet or two. And indeed most
		of the 'improvements' in XP are on the presentation level. If you
		look in some executables in the Windows directory, you find internal
		labels like &quot;ProductName: Microsoft Windows (TM) operating system,
		ProductVersion: 3.10&quot;. There's even DOS 5.0 code with a 1981-1991
		copyright date. What a great new product. Of course it makes sense
		to provide compatibility modes for old Windows applications, but
		to find the bulk of Windows 3.10 and DOS 5 (all of it 16-bit code)
		up to and including EDLIN, installed under the hood of Windows XP
		makes you wonder about the design principles that have gone into each
		&quot;new&quot; version of Windows.</p>

	<p>Microsoft released XP on a marketing budget of half a billion dollars
		to promote it. None of the new cosmetic bells and whistles in XP actually
		made it any more stable than Windows 2000 was, but that hasn't stopped
		Microsoft from marketing XP as the OS that &quot;keeps on running&quot;
		instead of crashing, and that protects the users from viruses. How's that
		again? Vista was also marketed as a &quot;multi-media operating system&quot;
		in spite of the fact that there's nothing multi-media about the OS itself.
		It comes bundled with a few applications for digital photos and video (which
		Microsoft bought and put into the box) and of course with Microsoft's own
		MediaPlayer application, but that has nothing to do with the operating system
		itself.</p>

	<p>XP's successor, Vista, turned out to be similarly long on empty
		marketing rhetoric and short on innovation. According to Microsoft Vista
		will &quot;Bring Clarity To Your World!&quot; and &quot;enhance your
		confidence in PC technology and give you a new outlook on the digital
		world around you&quot;. Vista was also said to &quot;help you to organize
		information intuitively and to stay in touch with information, people and
		resources, so you can enjoy life more!&quot; The truth is of course that
		this new version of Windows is mostly an 'XP 2nd edition' release. No
		surprises there. Vista has the usual many small improvements, several of
		which have something to do with security, and some attempts to work around
		Windows' most gaping shortcomings. None of these really address any real
		design flaws, except perhaps the improved access privileges. Vista also
		has a heavy dose of features related to Digital Rights Management (DRM)
		and more options for the integration of (and dependency on) Internet based
		services. There's a lot of extra gadgetry in the user interface and on the
		application level. Some menu's and features have been restructured a bit
		more conveniently (for example wireless networks are now grouped with the
		other network setup options and no longer separate) and everything looks
		very slick.</p>

	<p>There are no significant, major or structural improvements in Vista to
		justify an expensive upgrade, though. Many of the announced features have
		failed to materialize, and what's left is mostly a new search facility,
		a few extra features for laptop computers, a parental control feature,
		several features for remote access, and a downright bizarre set of
		hardware requirements. But in Vista the windows now have rounded corners,
		semi-transparent backgrounds, and zooming and fading effects! Oh yes!
		Vista also has shiny glassy buttons, a sidebar with a calendar and
		a photo slideshow, all of which is strangely reminescent of Apple's
		UI design. Buttons and icons now can show a tiny representation of a
		window or document. And of course the system folder icons now show a
		three-dimensional representation of a folder, standing vertically on a
		horizontal surface, complete with shadow effects! How...  innovative.</p>

	<h3>Applications: more of the same</h3>
	<p>In the application market things aren't much better. MS Word isn't
		quite the word processor that Word Perfect was, a fact that MS attempted
		to gloss over by adding functions that really belong to desktop publishing
		software (but cannot replace it for serious applications). As a result,
		Word lacks many features that users would like to have (such as the option
		to view markup codes) but at the same time it has become so loaded with
		other features that its complexity is actually counter-productive. Excel,
		originally developed on the Apple platform, doesn't really do anything
		that Lotus-123 couldn't do in the nineteen eighties (although it has a
		fancier user interface and more graphic capabilities) and comes loaded with
		macro bugs and version problems to boot. Microsoft Access is something
		halfway between a 'flat' database and a relational database system,
		combining the advantages of neither with the disadvantages of both. The
		first line in the 'About' window in Internet Explorer says &quot;Based
		on NCSA Mosaic&quot; (which was the very first web browser to be used
		during the Stone Age of the World Wide Web) and PowerPoint merely
		duplicates the functionality that other presentation packages already
		offered in the late nineteen eighties. (Unless of course you count the
		Visual Basic hooks that virus authors and hackers are having such a ball
		with.)</p>

	<p>In fact, <i>none of these products use any significant technology invented
			by Microsoft</i>. Sure, they're all dressed up like maypoles with tons of
		gadgetry and flashy colors, and the implementation of the old technology has
		become more streamlined, especially when it comes to exchanging data between
		applications. They've been ported to Windows so their user interfaces have a
		uniform look-and-feel (but are still inconsistent) and IBM's data exchange
		techniques such as OLE give the impression of integration. But in fact it's
		all old technology. This isn't innovation; it's recycling. To illustrate:
		several of the files that came with Word 97 (and perhaps with later versions
		as well) still contained the text &quot;Copyright WordPerfect Corporation 1994.
		All rights reserved.&quot; I rest my case.</p>

	<h3>ASP: old technology rewrapped</h3>
	<p>Microsoft's future plans are full of the same kind of
		&quot;innovation&quot;. Their long-term strategy involves client systems
		that will be used to access server-based or network-based applications and
		services.  This idea is known as ASP (Application Service Providing). It
		moves applications from the workstation to a central server, and does
		away with the need to install, maintain and run application software
		locally on workstations.</p>

	<p>Of course Microsoft claims that this approach is innovative. In
		truth there's very little innovative about it. Essentially it's a step
		back to the decades-old host-with-terminals approach. Microsoft will
		almost certainly be able to rewrap it in a more attractive package,
		but that's as far as their innovation is likely to go. All you need to
		offer network-based applications and services <em>today</em> (as well
		as twenty years ago) is a server (which would typically run  Unix) with
		a bunch of applications and some graphic terminals. Granted, the X
		protocol (the most popular graphic terminal standard on Unix systems)
		is more than a little ugly and unsuited for anything but LAN's. However,
		the implementation of a more elegant and efficient client/server protocol
		layer (e.g. ICA or something similar) would be rather trivial. At that
		point all that Microsoft's developers need to do is to recode their
		system and application products so that resources are used efficiently
		(as they should have done in the first place) and move the applications back
		to the server where they originated decades ago. Given the current sorry
		state of affairs on the Windows platform, that might even be an
		improvement... but not innovative.</p>

	<h3>Innovation? What innovation?</h3>
	<p>The machine in Redmond lumbers on. More gadgets, more flashy colors,
		more overhead, more old stuff with a new paint job, all marketed as new
		technology which they claim to have personally invented from scratch.
		They dress up their &quot;technological innovations&quot; with flashy names
		like Single Instance Store, to disguise the fact that Single Instance Store is
		nothing but a slightly souped-up version of the symbolic links that have been
		around on Unix systems for about three decades. Another &quot;innovation&quot;
		is the addition of the Narrator text-to-speech converter as an aid for the
		visually impaired. A useful feature, granted... but innovative? We've had
		commercial text-to-speech conversion since the early nineteen eighties.
		Even most of the cosmetic changes in Windows Vista were &quot;inspired&quot;
		by Apple's desktops, and Internet Explorer 7 was mostly an attempt to copy
		some of the most popular features from Mozilla Firefox.</p>

	<p>Microsoft apparently thinks that R&amp;D stands for 'Rewrap &amp; Disguise'.
		A baroque excess of features presents itself to the user, mainly to hide
		the fact that the software contains nothing that rightly could be
		called innovative. In spite of a marketing budget of some five billion dollars
		a year, the best Microsoft has managed to do is repackage various ideas as
		their own, list TCP/IP under 'Microsoft protocols' in Windows, tout that
		they've &quot;assisted with IPv6&quot; (they did <i>what,</i> exactly?) and
		of course they came up with an animated paper clip. Windows hasn't added one
		basic service to the PC that wasn't available on, say, a Sun workstation in
		1990. Yes, hardware has become cheaper, smaller, faster and more powerful
		(just like all other electronics on the market) so today's PCs look much
		better than those old workstations. But basically no new technology has been
		invented by Microsoft that really adds new capabilities to a personal
		computer.</p>

	<p>Microsoft Research, in spite of an astronomic budget, hasn't come up with
		any truly useful technology so far. Name one, just one, major piece of useful
		technology that's ostensibly been invented or developed by Microsoft.
		<em>One</em> single original concept, that's all I ask. Name it, and I'll tell
		you where they got it from.</p>

	<p>Innovation? Yeah, right.</p>
