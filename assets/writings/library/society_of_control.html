    <h2><a name="historik"></a>I. Historical</h2>
    <p>Foucault located the<i> disciplinary societies</i> in the eighteenth 
      and nineteenth centuries; they reach their height at the outset of the 
      twentieth. They initiate the organization of vast spaces of enclosure. 
      The individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, 
      each having its own laws: first the family; then the school ("you are 
      no longer in your family"); then the barracks ("you are no longer at school"); 
      then the factory; from time to time the hospital; possibly the prison, 
      the preeminent instance of the enclosed environment. It's the prison that 
      serves as the analogical model: at the sight of some laborers, the heroine 
      of Rossellini's<i> Europa '51</i> could exclaim, "I thought I was seeing 
      convicts."
    <p> 
    <p> Foucault has brilliantly analyzed the ideal project of these environments 
      of enclosure, particularly visible within the factory: to concentrate; 
      to distribute in space; to order in time; to compose a productive force 
      within the dimension of space-time whose effect will be greater than the 
      sum of its component forces. But what Foucault recognized as well was 
      the transience of this model: it succeeded that of the<i> societies of 
        sovereignty</i>, the goal and functions of which were something quite 
      different (to tax rather than to organize production, to rule on death 
      rather than to administer life); the transition took place over time, 
      and Napoleon seemed to effect the large-scale conversion from one society 
      to the other. But in their turn the disciplines underwent a crisis to 
      the benefit of new forces that were gradually instituted and which accelerated 
      after World War II: a disciplinary society was what we already no longer 
      were, what we had ceased to be.
    <p> 
    <p> We are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of 
      enclosure--prison, hospital, factory, school, family. The family is an 
      "interior," in crisis like all other interiors--scholarly, professional, 
      etc. The administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary 
      reforms: to reform schools, to reform industries, hospitals, the armed 
      forces, prisons. But everyone knows that these institutions are finished, 
      whatever the length of their expiration periods. It's only a matter of 
      administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the 
      installation of the new forces knocking at the door. These are the<i> 
        societies of control</i>, which are in the process of replacing disciplinary 
      societies. "Control" is the name Burroughs proposes as a term for the 
      new monster, one that Foucault recognizes as our immediate future. Paul 
      Virilio also is continually analyzing the ultrarapid forms of free-floating 
      control that replaced the old disciplines operating in the time frame 
      of a closed system. There is no need to invoke the extraordinary pharmaceutical 
      productions, the molecular engineering, the genetic manipulations, although 
      these are slated to enter the new process. There is no need to ask which 
      is the toughest regime, for it's within each of them that liberating and 
      enslaving forces confront one another. For example, in the crisis of the 
      hospital as environment of enclosure, neighborhood clinics, hospices, 
      and day care could at first express new freedom, but they could participate 
      as well in mechanisms of control that are equal to the harshest of confinements. 
      There is no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new weapons.
      <h2><a name="logik"></a>II. Logic</h2>
    <p> The different internments of spaces of enclosure through which the individual 
      passes are independent variables: each time one us supposed to start from 
      zero, and although a common language for all these places exists, it is<i> 
        analogical</i>. One the other hand, the different control mechanisms are 
      inseparable variations, forming a system of variable geometry the language 
      of which is numerical (which doesn't necessarily mean binary). Enclosures 
      are<i> molds</i>, distinct castings, but controls are a<i> modulation</i>, 
      like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment 
      to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to 
      point.
    <p> 
    <p> This is obvious in the matter of salaries: the factory was a body that 
      contained its internal forces at the level of equilibrium, the highest 
      possible in terms of production, the lowest possible in terms of wages; 
      but in a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, 
      and the corporation is a spirit, a gas. Of course the factory was already 
      familiar with the system of bonuses, but the corporation works more deeply 
      to impose a modulation of each salary, in states of perpetual metastability 
      that operate through challenges, contests, and highly comic group sessions. 
      If the most idiotic television game shows are so successful, it's because 
      they express the corporate situation with great precision. The factory 
      constituted individuals as a single body to the double advantage of the 
      boss who surveyed each element within the mass and the unions who mobilized 
      a mass resistance; but the corporation constantly presents the brashest 
      rivalry as a healthy form of emulation, an excellent motivational force 
      that opposes individuals against one another and runs through each, dividing 
      each within. The modulating principle of "salary according to merit" has 
      not failed to tempt national education itself. Indeed, just as the corporation 
      replaces the factory,<i> perpetual training</i> tends to replace the<i> 
        school</i>, and continuous control to replace the examination. Which is 
      the surest way of delivering the school over to the corporation.
    <p> 
    <p> In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again (from school 
      to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory), while in the societies 
      of control one is never finished with anything--the corporation, the educational 
      system, the armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and 
      the same modulation, like a universal system of deformation. In<i> The 
        Trial</i>, Kafka, who had already placed himself at the pivotal point 
      between two types of social formation, described the most fearsome of 
      judicial forms. The<i> apparent acquittal</i> of the disciplinary societies 
      (between two incarcerations); and the<i> limitless postponements</i> of 
      the societies of control (in continuous variation) are two very different 
      modes of juridicial life, and if our law is hesitant, itself in crisis, 
      it's because we are leaving one in order to enter the other. The disciplinary 
      societies have two poles: the signature that designates the<i> individual</i>, 
      and the number or administrative numeration that indicates his or her 
      position within a<i> mass</i>. This is because the disciplines never saw 
      any incompatibility between these two, and because at the same time power 
      individualizes and masses together, that is, constitutes those over whom 
      it exercises power into a body and molds the individuality of each member 
      of that body. (Foucault saw the origin of this double charge in the pastoral 
      power of the priest--the flock and each of its animals--but civil power 
      moves in turn and by other means to make itself lay "priest.") In the 
      societies of control, on the other hand, what is important is no longer 
      either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a<i> password</i>, 
      while on the other hand disciplinary societies are regulated by<i> watchwords</i> 
      (as much from the point of view of integration as from that of resistance). 
      The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to 
      information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the 
      mass/individual pair. Individuals have become<i> "dividuals,"</i> and 
      masses, samples, data, markets, or<i> "banks."</i> Perhaps it is money 
      that expresses the distinction between the two societies best, since discipline 
      always referred back to minted money that locks gold as numerical standard, 
      while control relates to floating rates of exchange, modulated according 
      to a rate established by a set of standard currencies. The old monetary 
      mole is the animal of the space of enclosure, but the serpent is that 
      of the societies of control. We have passed from one animal to the other, 
      from the mole to the serpent, in the system under which we live, but also 
      in our manner of living and in our relations with others. The disciplinary 
      man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is 
      undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. Everywhere<i> surfing</i> 
      has already replaced the older<i> sports</i>.
    <p> 
    <p> Types of machines are easily matched with each type of society--not 
      that machines are determining, but because they express those social forms 
      capable of generating them and using them. The old societies of sovereignty 
      made use of simple machines--levers, pulleys, clocks; but the recent disciplinary 
      societies equipped themselves with machines involving energy, with the 
      passive danger of entropy and the active danger of sabotage; the societies 
      of control operate with machines of a third type, computers, whose passive 
      danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy or the introduction of 
      viruses. This technological evolution must be, even more profoundly, a 
      mutation of capitalism, an already well-known or familiar mutation that 
      can be summed up as follows: nineteenth-century capitalism is a capitalism 
      of concentration, for production and for property. It therefore erects 
      a factory as a space of enclosure, the capitalist being the owner of the 
      means of production but also, progressively, the owner of other spaces 
      conceived through analogy (the worker's familial house, the school). As 
      for markets, they are conquered sometimes by specialization, sometimes 
      by colonization, sometimes by lowering the costs of production. But in 
      the present situation, capitalism is no longer involved in production, 
      which it often relegates to the Third World, even for the complex forms 
      of textiles, metallurgy, or oil production. It's a capitalism of higher-order 
      production. It no-longer buys raw materials and no longer sells the finished 
      products: it buys the finished products or assembles parts. What it wants 
      to sell is services but what it wants to buy is stocks. This is no longer 
      a capitalism for production but for the product, which is to say, for 
      being sold or marketed. Thus is essentially dispersive, and the factory 
      has given way to the corporation. The family, the school, the army, the 
      factory are no longer the distinct analogical spaces that converge towards 
      an owner--state or private power--but coded figures--deformable and transformable--of 
      a single corporation that now has only stockholders. Even art has left 
      the spaces of enclosure in order to enter into the open circuits of the 
      bank. The conquests of the market are made by grabbing control and no 
      longer by disciplinary training, by fixing the exchange rate much more 
      than by lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by 
      specialization of production. Corruption thereby gains a new power. Marketing 
      has become the center or the "soul" of the corporation. We are taught 
      that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the 
      world. The operation of markets is now the instrument of social control 
      and forms the impudent breed of our masters. Control is short-term and 
      of rapid rates of turnover, but also continuous and without limit, while 
      discipline was of long duration, infinite and discontinuous. Man is no 
      longer man enclosed, but man in debt. It is true that capitalism has retained 
      as a constant the extreme poverty of three-quarters of humanity, too poor 
      for debt, too numerous for confinement: control will not only have to 
      deal with erosions of frontiers but with the explosions within shanty 
      towns or ghettos.
      <h2><a name="programm">III. Program</a></h2>
    <p>The conception of a control mechanism, giving the position of any element 
      within an open environment at any given instant (whether animal in a reserve 
      or human in a corporation, as with an electronic collar), is not necessarily 
      one of science fiction. Felix Guattari has imagined a city where one would 
      be able to leave one's apartment, one's street, one's neighborhood, thanks 
      to one's (dividual) electronic card that raises a given barrier; but the 
      card could just as easily be rejected on a given day or between certain 
      hours; what counts is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each 
      person's position--licit or illicit--and effects a universal modulation.
    <p> 
    <p> The socio-technological study of the mechanisms of control, grasped 
      at their inception, would have to be categorical and to describe what 
      is already in the process of substitution for the disciplinary sites of 
      enclosure, whose crisis is everywhere proclaimed. It may be that older 
      methods, borrowed from the former societies of sovereignty, will return 
      to the fore, but with the necessary modifications. What counts is that 
      we are at the beginning of something. In the<i> prison system</i>: the 
      attempt to find penalties of "substitution," at least for petty crimes, 
      and the use of electronic collars that force the convicted person to stay 
      at home during certain hours. For the<i> school system</i>: continuous 
      forms of control, and the effect on the school of perpetual training, 
      the corresponding abandonment of all university research, the introduction 
      of the "corporation" at all levels of schooling. For the<i> hospital system</i>: 
      the new medicine "without doctor or patient" that singles out potential 
      sick people and subjects at risk, which in no way attests to individuation--as 
      they say--but substitutes for the individual or numerical body the code 
      of a "dividual" material to be controlled. In the<i> corporate system</i>: 
      new ways of handling money, profits, and humans that no longer pass through 
      the old factory form. These are very small examples, but ones that will 
      allow for better understanding of what is meant by the crisis of the institutions, 
      which is to say, the progressive and dispersed installation of a new system 
      of domination. One of the most important questions will concern the ineptitude 
      of the unions: tied to the whole of their history of struggle against 
      the disciplines or within the spaces of enclosure, will they be able to 
      adapt themselves or will they give way to new forms of resistance against 
      the societies of control? Can we already grasp the rough outlines of the 
      coming forms, capable of threatening the joys of marketing? Many young 
      people strangely boast of being "motivated"; they re-request apprenticeships 
      and permanent training. It's up to them to discover what they're being 
      made to serve, just as their elders discovered, not without difficulty, 
      the telos of the disciplines. The coils of a serpent are even more complex 
      that the burrows of a molehill.
