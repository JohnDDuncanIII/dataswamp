      <p style="text-align:left">Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.<br>
        &quot;Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &quot;Hacker Arrested after<br>
        Bank Tampering&quot;...<br>
        <br>
        Damn kids. They're all alike.<br>
        <br>
        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's<br>
        technobrain ever take a look behind the eyes of the Hacker? Did you ever<br>
        wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        <br><br>
        I am a Hacker, enter my world....<br>
        <br>
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most<br>
        of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br>
        <br>
        Damn underachiever. They're all alike.<br>
        <br>
        I made a discovery today. I found a comupter. Wait a second,<br>
        this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake it's<br>
        because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me...<br>
        Or feels threatened by me...<br>
        Or thinks I'm a smart ass...<br>
        Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...<br>
        <br>
        Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.<br>
        <br>
        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing<br>
        through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an<br>
        electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencys<br>
        is sought... a bored is found.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot;<br>
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked<br>
        to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br>
        <br>
        Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...<br>
        <br>
        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby<br>
        food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you<br>
        did let slip were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by<br>
        sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had somthing to<br>
        teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in<br>
        the desert.<br>
        <br>
        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the<br>
        switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of the service already<br>
        existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by<br>
        profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you<br>
        call us criminals. We seek after knowledge, and you call us criminals.<br>
        We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religous<br>
        bias... and you call us criminals.<br>
        You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and<br>
        lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the<br>
        criminals.<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I am a crimial. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is<br>
        that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look<br>
        like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something you will never<br>
        forgive me for.<br>
        <br>
        I am a Hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this<br>
        individual, but you can't stop us all. After all... we're all alike.<br></p>
