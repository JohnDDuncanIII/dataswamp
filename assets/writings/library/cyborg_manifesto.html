		<P>AN IRONIC DREAM OF A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</P>

		<P>&nbsp;This chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful
			to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy
			is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has
			always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better
			stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions
			of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism.
			Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting
			on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions
			that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension
			of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary
			and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical
			strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within
			socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the
			image of the cyborg.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism,
			a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality
			is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a
			world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed
			'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective
			object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political
			kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative
			apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter
			of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience
			in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but
			the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs - creatures simultaneously
			animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>150</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism
			and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a
			power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg 'sex' restores
			some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such
			nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is
			uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream
			of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism
			seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence,
			an $84 billion item in 1984'sUS defence budget. I am making an argument
			for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as
			an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael
			Foucault's biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very
			open field.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras,
			theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are
			cyborgs. Ths cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg
			is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined
			centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the
			traditions of 'Western' science and politics--the tradition of racist, male-dominant
			capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation
			of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction
			of the self from the reflections of the other - the relation between organism
			and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been
			the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter
			is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility
			in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist
			culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian
			tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world
			without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation
			is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar,
			attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic
			utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished
			manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein,
			the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds
			are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression,
			which we need to understand for our survival.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with
			bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions
			to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of
			the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story
			in the Western sense - a 'final' irony since the cyborg is also the awful
			apocalyptic telos of the</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>151</P>

		<P>'West's' escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate
			self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story
			in the 'Western', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity,
			fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom
			all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history,
			the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis
			and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis,
			in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend
			on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and
			enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg
			skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western
			sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of
			its teleology as star wars.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and
			perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence.
			No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines
			a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in
			the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no
			longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other.
			The rela-tionships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity
			and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the
			hopes of Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to
			save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication
			of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city
			and cosmos. The eyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic
			family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize
			the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning
			to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if eyborgs can subvert the apocalypse
			of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy.
			Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary
			of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural feel for
			united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble
			with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of
			militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But
			illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins.
			Their fathers, after all, are inessential.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter,
			but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the
			following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible.
			By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary
			between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of
			uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks--language
			tool</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>152</P>

		<P>use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles
			the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need
			for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm
			the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements
			for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are
			a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach
			of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two
			centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge
			and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched
			in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social
			science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should
			be fought as a form of child abuse.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific
			culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room
			for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary.2
			The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and
			animal is transgressed. Far from signalling a walling off of people from
			other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight
			coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine.
			Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of
			the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism
			and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or
			history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving,
			self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man's dream, only mock
			it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that
			masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid.
			Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly
			ambiguous the difference between natural and art)ficial, mind and body,
			self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that
			used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively,
			and we ourselves frighteningly inert.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by
			the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we
			engage in the play of writing and reading the world.3 'Textualization' of
			everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by
			Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived
			relations of domination that ground the 'play' of arbitrary reading.4 It
			is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert
			myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the
			biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature --
			a</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>153</P>

		<P>source of insight and promise of innocence -- is undermined, probably
			fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with
			it the ontology grounding 'Western' epistemology. But the alternative is
			not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence,
			like the accounts of technological determinism destroying 'man' by the 'machine'
			or 'meaningful political action' by the 'text'. Who cyborgs will be is a
			radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees
			and artefacts have politics, so why shouldn't we (de Waal, 1982; Winner,
			1980)?</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between
			physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on
			the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a
			kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances* as a marker
			of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong,
			but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially
			microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern
			machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father's ubiquity and
			spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in
			molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference
			for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western
			stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our
			experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power;
			small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise
			missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s
			with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our
			best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because
			they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum,
			and these machines are eminently portable, mobile -- a matter of immense
			human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being
			both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt
			machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially.
			They are about consciousness - or its simulation.5 They are floating signIfiers
			moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings
			of the displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs
			of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist
			politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the
			'hardest' science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the
			realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation
			of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers
			are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution</P>

		<P>*The US equivalent of Mills &amp; Boon.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>154</P>

		<P>associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases
			evoked by these clean machines are 'no more' than the minuscule coding changes
			of an antigen in the immune system, 'no more' than the experience of stress.
			The nimble fingers of 'Oriental' women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon
			Victorian girls with doll's houses, women's enforced attention to the small
			take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice
			taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural
			cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail*
			whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and
			dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part
			of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists
			and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine,
			idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formula-tions,
			and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific
			culture. From One-DimensionalMan (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature
			(Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have
			insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined
			organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that
			the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification
			of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of
			perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for
			other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of
			a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in
			a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation
			of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another
			perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities
			in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines,
			not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints.
			The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because
			each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other
			vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision
			or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate;
			in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent
			myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore
			Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting
			the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools</P>

		<P>* A practice at once both spiritual and political that linked guards
			and arrested anti-nuclear demonstrators in the Alameda County jail in California
			in the early 1985.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>155</P>

		<P>Of technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form
			that acutally manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts,
			Christians, mothers, and Leninists long enough to disarm the state. Fission
			Impossible is the name of the affinity group in my town.(Affinity: related
			not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for
			another, avidiy.)6</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>FRACTURED IDENTITIES</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>It has become difficult to name one's feminism by a single adjective
			-- or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness
			of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial,
			and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical
			constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis for belief
			in 'essential' unity. There is nothing about teeing 'female' that naturally
			binds women. There is not even such a state as 'being' female, itself a
			highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses
			and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement
			forced on us by the terrible historica experience of the contradictory social
			realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as
			'us' in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a
			potent political myth called 'us', and what could motivate enlistment in
			this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention
			among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman
			elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women's dominations of each other.
			For me - and for many who share a similar historical location in white,
			professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies
			- the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history
			for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind
			of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But
			there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition
			- affinity, not identity.7</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Chela Sandoval (n.d., 1984), from a consideration of specific historical
			moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of colour,
			has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called 'oppositional
			consciousness', born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused
			stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. 'Women
			of color', a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate,
			as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all
			the signs of Man in 'Western' traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist
			identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist
			identity is fully political, whatever might be said abut other possible
			postmodernisms. Sandoval's oppositional consciousness is about contradic-</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>156</P>

		<P>tory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and
			pluralisms.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Sandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying
			who is a woman of colour. She notes that the definition of the group has
			been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US
			black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or
			as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities,
			left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called 'women
			and blacks', who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category
			'woman' negated all non-white women; 'black' negated all non-black people,
			as well as all black women. But there was also no 'she', no singularity,
			but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical
			identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously
			constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of
			natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of
			affinity, of political kinship.8 Unlike the 'woman' of some streams of the
			white women's movement in the United States, there is no naturalization
			of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available
			through the power of oppositional consciousness.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Sandoval's argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists
			out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; that is
			to say, discourse dissolving the 'West' and its highest product - the one
			who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos
			called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically,
			the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists.9
			Sandoval argues that 'women of colour' have a chance to build an effective
			unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary
			subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences
			of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/
			poetic mechanics of identification built into reading 'the poem', that generative
			core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among
			contemporary feminists from different 'moments' or 'conversations' in feminist
			practice to taxonomize the women's movement to make one's own political
			tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to
			remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle
			among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units
			called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms
			are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit
			ontology and epistemology.10 Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies
			to police deviation from official women's experience. And of course, 'women's
			culture', like women of colour, is consciously created by</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>157</P>

		<P>mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of poetry, music, and certain
			forms of academic practice have been pre-eminent. The politics of race and
			culture in the US women's movements are intimately interwoven. The common
			achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political
			unity without relying on a logic of appropriation, incorpora-tion, and taxonomic
			identification.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination
			or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifica-tions
			for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scient-ism,
			and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint.
			I think that radical and socialist/Marxist-feminisms have also undermined
			their/our own epistemological strategies and that this is a crucially valuable
			step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all 'epistemologies'
			as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build
			effective affinities.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>It is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand-points,
			epistemologies as achievements of people committed to changing the world,
			has been part of the process showing the limits of identification. The acid
			tools of postmodernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological
			discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in
			dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly
			conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body. But
			with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the
			Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naivete
			of innocence. But what would another political myth for socialist-feminism
			look like? What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, permanently
			unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful,
			effective - and, ironically, socialist-feminist?</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>I do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need
			for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of 'race', 'gender',
			'sexuality', and 'class'. I also do not know of any other time when the
			kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of 'us'
			have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape
			of reality to any of'them'. Or at least 'we' cannot claim innocence from
			practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists,
			discovered (that is, were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence
			of the category 'woman'. That consciousness changes the geography of all
			previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein.
			Cyborg feminists have to argue that 'we' do not want any more natural matrix
			of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary
			insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough
			damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>158</P>

		<P>century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the
			reflexive strategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for
			weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that
			so prophetically ends salvation history.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Both Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simul-taneously
			naturalized and denatured the category 'woman' and conscious-ness of the
			social lives of 'women'. Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both
			kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labour
			which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship
			is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product.
			Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice.
			Labour is the pre-eminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to
			overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing
			the world. Labour is the humanizing activity that makes man; labour is an
			ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge
			of subjugation and alienation.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by allying itself
			with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement of both
			Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of
			labour to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation
			was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist
			patriarchy. In particular, women's labour in the household and women's activity
			as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense),
			entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labour.
			The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological
			structure of'labour'. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not 'natur-alize'
			unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted
			in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure
			of labour or of its analogue, women's activity.11 The inheritance of Marxian
			humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me.
			The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily
			responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize
			them.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Catherine MacKinnon's (198Z, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself
			a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies
			of Western theories of identity grounding action.12 It is factually and
			politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse 'moments' or 'conversations'
			in recent women's politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon's version.
			But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology
			- including their negations - erase or police difference. Only one of the
			effects of MacKinnon's theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous
			field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>159</P>

		<P>of experience, of women's identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for
			all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this
			tale of radical feminism achieves its end - the unity of women - by enforcing
			the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/
			socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact.
			And MacKinnon's theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist
			revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>MacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analyt-ical
			strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but
			at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men's constitu-tion
			and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon's 'ontology'
			constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another's desire, not the self's
			labour, is the origin of 'woman'. She therefore develops a theory of consciousness
			that enforces what can count as 'women's' experience - anything that names
			sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as 'women' can be concerned.
			Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; that
			is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Perversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemolo-gical
			status of labour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able
			to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual object)fication,
			not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the
			realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and
			abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product,
			but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject,
			since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted
			by another's desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent
			separation of the labourer from his product.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>MacKinnon's radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme;
			it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other
			women's political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what
			Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing - feminists' consciousness
			of the non-existence of women, except as products of men's desire. I think
			MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly
			ground women's unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions of
			any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an
			even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian
			standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical
			difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon's
			intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential'
			non-existence of women is not reassuring.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of
			history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named
			by socialist feminists as forms of labour only if the activity can somehow
			be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two
			tendencies, one rooted in labour, one in sex, both calling the consequences
			of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality 'false consciousness'.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Beyond either the diff~culties or the contributions in the argument of
			any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have
			tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly
			constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how
			else could the 'Western' author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex
			other forms of domination by expanding its basic categories through analogy,
			simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white
			radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence.
			History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to
			establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much
			else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman
			and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure
			of my caricature looks like this:</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>socialist feminism--structure of class // wage labour // alienation
				labour, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race radical
				feminism - structure of gender // sexual appropriation // objectification</P>
			<P>sex, by analogy labour, by extension reproduction, by addition race</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In another context, the French theorist, Julia Kristeva, claimed women
			appeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along with groups
			like youth. Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to remembering
			that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, 'race' did not always
			exist, 'class' has a historical genesis, and 'homosexuals' are quite junior.
			It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man - and so
			the essence of woman - breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection
			among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex.
			'Advanced capitalism' is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical
			moment. In the 'Western' sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident
			that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists
			were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed
			women's particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been,
			at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and
			practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of
			domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But
			in the consciousness of our failures, we</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>161</P>

		<P>risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing
			task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some
			are poles of world historical systems of domination. 'Epistemology' is about
			knowing the difference.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>THE INFORMATICS OF DOMINATION</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would
			like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist
			and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the
			extent and importance of rearrangements in world-wide social relations tied
			to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about
			fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging
			system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created
			by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic,
			industrial society to a polymorphous, information system--from all work
			to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the
			dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from
			the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I
			have called the informatics of domination:</P>

		</P>

		<P>162</P>

		<P>This list suggests several interesting things.13 First, the objects on
			the right-hand side cannot be coded as 'natural', a realization that subverts
			naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically
			or materially. It's not just that igod'is dead; so is the 'goddess'. Or
			both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological
			politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think
			in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints,
			rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction
			is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits
			as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction
			can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic
			aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will
			be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy
			and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly
			unmasking the irrationalism.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Likewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated
			in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence
			scores. It is 'irrational' to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized.
			For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives
			way to a new practice called 'experimental ethnography' in which an organic
			object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology,
			we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development
			and under-development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects
			or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly;
			no 'natural' architectures constrain system design. The financial districts
			in all the world's cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade
			zones, proclaim this elementary fact of'late capitalism'. The entire universe
			of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems
			in</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>163</P>

		<P>communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text
			(for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>One should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions
			and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries-- and not on the integrity
			of natural objects. 'Integrity' or 'sincerity' of the Western self gives
			way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies
			applied to women's capacities to give birth to new human beings will be
			developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal
			achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will be formulated
			in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings,
			like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture
			whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects,
			spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced
			with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed
			for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends
			the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed
			so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this
			universe is stress - communications breakdown (Hogness, 1983). The cyborg
			is not subject to Foucault's biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics,
			a much more potent field of operations.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge
			which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us
			to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded
			as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in 'the West'
			since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia
			(Sofoulis) might put it, they have been 'techno-digested'. The dichotomies
			between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and
			private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are
			all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/
			exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and com-munication
			called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public
			arena, the body itself- all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite,
			polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others - consequences
			that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent
			oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential
			for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist
			politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations
			of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings
			structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled,
			postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must
			code.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>164</P>

		<P>Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools
			recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations
			for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially
			understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social
			interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments
			for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth,
			instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical
			anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth
			and tool mutually constitute each other.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed
			by a common move - the translation of the world into a problem of coding,
			a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control
			disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly,
			investment, and exchange.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem
			in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled)
			systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons
			deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution
			to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key
			operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow
			of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries
			differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of
			quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation,
			and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The
			biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system
			breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can
			be condensed into the metaphor C31, command-controlcommunication-intelligence,
			the military's symbol for its operations theory.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>In modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding
			can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary
			theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into prob-lems
			of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs
			research broadly.14 In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects
			of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information-processing
			devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the
			history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated
			medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition
			systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for
			us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind
			of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its
			communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference
			between self and other. Human babies with</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>165</P>

		<P>baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity-- for animal rights activists
			at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men
			and intravenous drug users are the 'privileged' victims of an awful immune
			system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries
			and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987).</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>But these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been
			at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support
			my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transforma-tions
			in the structure of the world for us. Communications technologies depend
			on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power,
			welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication
			of our imaginations, labour-control systems, medical construc-tions of our
			bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and
			religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Micro-electronics
			is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Microelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and
			word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies,
			and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies
			concern more than human reproducdon. Biology as a powerful engineering science
			for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for
			industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentadon, agriculture,
			and energy. Communicadons sciences and biology are construcdons of natural-technical
			objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism
			is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms.
			The 'multinational' material organization of the production and reproduction
			of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction
			of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining
			images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal
			never seemed more feeble.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>I have used Rachel Grossman's (1980) image of women in the integrated
			circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured
			through the social relations of science and technology.15 I used the odd
			circumlocution, 'the social relations of science and technology', to indicate
			that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical
			system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase
			should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of
			power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour,
			1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated
			social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant to effective
			progressive politics.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>166</P>

		<P>THE 'HOMEWORK ECONOMY' OUTSIDE 'THE HOME'</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The 'New Industrial Revolution' is producing a new world-wide working
			class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities. The extreme mobility
			of capital and the emerging international division of labour are intertwined
			with the emergence of new collecdvities, and the weakening of familiar groupings.
			These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced
			industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss,
			and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men.
			It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred labour
			force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors,
			particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and involves
			reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumphon, and producdon. In the prototypical
			Silicon Valley, many women's lives have been structured around employment
			in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial
			heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin
			or most other forms of traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness
			and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity
			of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences
			in culture, family, religion, education, and language.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Richard Gordon has called this new situation the 'homework economy'.16
			Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in connecdon
			with electronics assembly, Gordon intends 'homework economy' to name a restructuring
			of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female
			jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being redefined as both
			literally female and feminized, whether performed by men or women. To be
			feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled,
			reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less as workers than
			as servers; subjected to dme arrangements on and off the paid job that make
			a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders
			on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old
			strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework
			economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny
			that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously
			excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the concept indicates that factory,
			home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women
			are crucial - and need to be analysed for differences among women and for
			meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is
			made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The success of the
			attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men's unionized jobs is deaf
			to</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>167</P>

		<P>the power of the new communications technologies to integrate and control
			labour despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences
			of the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family
			(male) wage (if they ever had access to this white privilege) and in the
			character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for example,
			office work and nursing.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the
			collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women
			to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old
			people. The feminization of poverty-- generated by dismantling the welfare
			state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and
			sustained by the expectation that women's wages will not be matched by a
			male income for the support of children-- has become an urgent focus. The
			causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, class,
			or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions
			of women on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly
			as a funcdon of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind
			of integration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy
			is new. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have
			achieved an escape from (barely) paid domeshc service and who now hold clerical
			and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implicadons for condnued enforced
			black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas of
			the Third World increasingly find themselves the sole or major source of
			a cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problemadc.
			These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and
			politics of gender and race.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Within the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commercial/
			early industrial, monopoly, multinational) --tied to nationalism, imperialism,
			and multinationalism, and related to Jameson's three dominant aesthetic
			periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism --I would argue that specific
			forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political
			and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally,
			ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal
			nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and private and
			accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century
			Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced)
			by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering
			of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions
			represented in Greenwich Village around the First World War; and (3) the
			'family' of the homework economy with its oxymoronic structure of women-headed
			households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification
			and erosion of gender itself.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>168</P>

		<P>This is the context in which the projections for world-wide structural
			unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture
			of the homework economy. As robodcs and related technologies put men out
			of work in 'developed' countries and exacerbate failure to generate male
			jobs in Third World 'development', and as the automated of fice becomes
			the rule even in labour-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies.
			Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face
			the structural underemployment ('feminization') of black men, as well as
			their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer
			a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and community life are interwoven
			with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated
			the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend
			with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances
			on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just
			mice.</P>

		<P>The new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food
			production for subsistence world-wide. Rae Lessor Blumberg (1983) estimates
			that women produce about 50 per cent of the world's subsistence food.17
			Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased high-tech
			commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous
			because their responsibilides to provide food do not diminish, and their
			reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies
			interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions
			of labour and differential gender migration patterns.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of'privatization'
			that Ros Petchesky (1981) has analysed, in which militarization, right-wing
			family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate
			(and state) property as private synergistically interact.18 The new communications
			technologies are fundamental to the eradication of 'public life' for everyone.
			This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military establishment
			at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially of women.
			Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televi-sions seem
			crucial to production of modern forms of 'private life'. The culture of
			video games is heavily orientated to individual compedtion and extraterrestrial
			warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations
			that can contemplate destruction of the planet and a sci-fi escape from
			its consequences. More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other
			realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable. These are the
			technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect exchange-- and incidentally
			enable tourism, that perfect practice of mobility and exchange, to emerge
			as one of the world's largest single industries.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and
			of</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>169</P>

		<P>reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sexuality
			and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction-
			and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological
			origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable
			dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles.19 These sociobiological
			stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or
			cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive
			situations is the medical one, where women's bodies have boundaries newly
			permeable to both 'visualization' and 'intervention'. Of course, who controls
			the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneubcs is a major
			feminist issue. The speculum served as an icon of women's claiming their
			bodies in the 1970S; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed
			body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduction.
			Self-help is not enough. The technologies of visualization recall the important
			cultural practice of hundng with the camera and the deeply predatory nature
			of a photographic consciousness.20 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are
			central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of
			personal and social possibility.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Another critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies
			is the reformulation of expectations, culture, work, and reproduction for
			the large scientific and technical work-force. A major social and political
			danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the
			masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of colour,
			confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several varieties, and general
			redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses
			ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate
			socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational
			categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology
			that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.21</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>This issue is only one aspect of enquiry into the possibility of a feminist
			science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production
			of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have?
			How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements?
			What kind of political accountability can be constructed to the women together
			across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be
			ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with
			and-military science facility conversion action groups? Many sciendfic and
			technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do
			not want to work on military science.22 Can these personal preferences and
			cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this professional
			middle class in which women, including women of colour, are coming to be
			fairly numerous?</P>

		<P>WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Let me summarize the picture of women's historical locations in advanced
			industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through
			the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible
			ideologically to characterize women's lives by the disdnction of public
			and private domains-- suggested by images of the division of working-class
			life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and
			of gender existence into personal and political realms --it is now a totally
			misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct
			each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image,
			suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of
			boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. 'Networking' is
			both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy -- weaving
			is for oppositional cyborgs.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>So let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination
			and trace one vision of women's 'place' in the integrated circuit, touching
			only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view
			of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State,
			School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically
			and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic
			photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated
			and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis
			and practical work. However, there is no 'place' for women in these networks,
			only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women's cyborg
			identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life,
			we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the
			following list from a standpoint of'idendfication', of a unitary self. The
			issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Home: Women-headed households, serial monogamy, flight of men, old women
			alone, technology of domestic work, paid homework, re-emergence of home
			sweat-shops, home-based businesses and telecom-muting, electronic cottage,
			urban homelessness, migration, module architecture, reinforced (simulated)
			nuclear family, intense domestic violence.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Market: Women's continuing consumption work, newly targeted to buy the
			profusion of new production from the new technologies (especially as the
			competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid
			dangerous mass unemployment necessitates finding ever bigger new markets
			for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled
			with advertising targeting of the numerous affluent groups and neglect of
			the previous mass markets; growing importance of</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>171</P>

		<P>informal markets in labour and commodities parallel to high-tech, affluent
			market structures; surveillance systems through electronic funds transfer;
			intensified market abstraction (commodification) of experience, resulting
			in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme
			mobility (abstraction) of marketing/financing systems; inter-penetration
			of sexual and labour markets; intensified sexualization of abstracted and
			alienated consumption.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Paid Work Place: Continued intense sexual and racial division of labour,
			but considerable growth of membership in privileged occupational categories
			for many white women and people of colour; impact of new technologies on
			women's work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles),
			agriculture, electronics; international restructuring of the working classes;
			development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy
			(flex time, part time, over time, no time); homework and out work; increased
			pressures for two-tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people
			in cash-dependent populations world-wide with no experience or no further
			hope of stable employment; most labour 'marginal' or 'feminized'.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>State: Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with
			increased surveillance and control; citizenship by telematics; imperialism
			and political power broadly in the form of information rich/information
			poor differentiation; increased high-tech militarization increasingly opposed
			by many social groups; reduction of civil service jobs as a result of the
			growing capital intensification of office work, with implications for occupational
			mobility for women of colour; growing privadzation of material and ideological
			life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization,
			the high-tech forms of bourgeois capitalist personal and public life; invisibility
			of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms
			of belief in abstract enemies.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>School: Deepening coupling of high-tech capital needs and public educa-tion
			at all levels, differentiated by race, class, and gender; managerial classes
			involved in educational reform and refunding at the cost of</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>remaining progressive educational democratic structures for children
			and teachers; education for mass ignorance and repression in technocratic
			and militarized culture; growing and-science mystery cults in dissendng
			and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy
			among white women and people of colour; growing industrial direction of
			education (especially higher education) by science-based multinationals
			(particularly in electronics- and biotechnology-dependent companies); highly
			educated, numerous elites in a progressively bimodal society.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Clinic-hospital: Intensified machine-body relations; renegotiations of</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>172</P>

		<P>public metaphors which channel personal experience of the body, particularly
			in relation to reproduction, immune system functions, and 'stress' phenomena;
			intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical
			implications of women's unrealized, potential control of their relation
			to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles
			over meanings and means of health in environments pervaded by high technology
			products and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified
			struggle over state responsibility for health; continued ideological role
			of popular health movements as a major form of American politics.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Church: Electronic fundamentalist 'super-saver' preachers solemnizing
			the union of electronic capital and automated fetish gods; intensified importance
			of churches in resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women's
			meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality,
			intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive
			intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure
			of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture
			interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency
			of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is
			plain. There is much now being tione, and the grounds for political work
			are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collecdve struggle
			for women in paid work, like SEIU's District 925,* should be a high priority
			for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring
			of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also
			are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization,
			involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the
			largely white male industrial unions.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science
			and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be uldmately
			depressed by the implications of late twentieth-century women's relation
			to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and
			reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and
			have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and
			people's complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial
			to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women's points of
			view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in
			the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unides
			mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories
			of clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology'</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>173</P>

		<P>versus 'manipulated false consciousness', but subtle understanding of
			emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing
			the rules of the game.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity
			across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist
			analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of
			hardship experienced world-wide in connection with the social relations
			of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is
			not transparently clear, and we lack aufficiently subtle connections for
			collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts
			- Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological-- to clarify even 'our'
			experience are rudimentary.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>I am conscious of the odd perspecdve provided by my historical position
			- a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik's
			impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as
			much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as
			by the women's movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on
			the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American
			technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing
			on the present defeats.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The permanent pardality of feminist points of view has consequences for
			our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We
			do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common
			language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful
			naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense,
			dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps,
			ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how
			not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of
			pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social
			relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>CYBORGS: A MYTH OF POLITICAL IDENTITY</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>I want to conclude with a myth about idendty and boundaries which might
			inform late twentieth-century political imaginations (Plate 1). I am indebted
			in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley,
			James Tiptree, Jr, Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda McIntyre.23
			These are our story-tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high-tech
			worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring concephons of bodily boundaries
			and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be
			credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery
			is to world view, and so to political language.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their
			differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology,
			and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from
			imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.24</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>American radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne
			Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations - and perhaps restricted
			too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.25 They
			insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic
			systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism,
			replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval's terms as
			oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply
			bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late
			capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are
			also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilides
			inherent in the breakdown of clean disdnctions between organism and machine
			and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity
			of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric
			possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political 'technological'
			pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight
			into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions
			of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Earlier I suggested that 'women of colour' might be understood as a cyborg
			idendty, a potent subjecdvity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities
			and in the complex political-historical layerings of her 'biomythography',
			Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural
			grids mapping this potential, Audre Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the
			title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the
			offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard
			as the enemy prevendug their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore,
			inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential
			amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division,
			competition, and exploitation in the same industries. 'Women of colour'
			are the preferred labour force for the science-based industries, the real
			women for whom the world-wide sexual market, labour market, and politics
			of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in
			the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools,
			educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes
			the 'cheap' female labour so attractive to the multinationals.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the 'oral primidve', literacy
			is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well
			as</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>175</P>

		<P>men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading
			and wridng. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups.
			Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between
			oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more
			recently to the erosion of that distinction in 'postmodernist' theories
			attacking the phallogo-centrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic,
			phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.26
			Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political
			struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and
			stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access
			to the power to signify; but this dme that power must be neither phallic
			nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination
			of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before
			Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original
			innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that
			marked them as other.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and
			displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling
			origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western
			culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing
			for fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentrie origin stories most crucial
			for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies - teehnologies
			that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics - that have recently
			textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg
			stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert
			command and control.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of
			women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the
			rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings
			of the stom~ of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mesdzo 'bastard'
			race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry
			special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983)
			in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never
			possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided
			in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and
			so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to
			natural names, mother's or father's.27 Moraga's writing, her superb literacy,
			is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche's mastery
			of the conqueror's language -- a violation, an illegitimate production,
			that allows survival. Moraga's language is not 'whole'; it is self-consciously
			spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror's languages. But
			it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>176</P>

		<P>violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women
			of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not
			because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries,
			to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable
			apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to
			be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral
			of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga's body, affirms it as
			the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the
			unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of 'original
			illiteracy' of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve
			before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not
			the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family
			of Man.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of
			the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language
			and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that
			translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism.
			That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing
			in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings
			which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire,
			the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the
			structure and modes of reproduction of 'Western' idendty, of nature and
			culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. 'We' did not
			originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and
			epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider
			replications of 'texts'.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics
			in 'our' privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other
			dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer
			to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have
			run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary
			subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent
			position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature.
			With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis
			promising protection from hostile 'masculine' separation, but written into
			the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history,
			to recognize 'oneself' as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the
			need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering.
			Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins
			and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed
			her from the evil mother of</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>177</P>

		<P>masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation.
			Every, story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return
			to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation,
			the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation;
			that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These
			plots are ruled by a reproductive politics --rebirth without flaw, perfection,
			abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off,
			but all agree they have less selflhood, weaker individuation, more fusion
			to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is
			another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that
			does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginaw.
			It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not
			of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so
			as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear
			on cue, no matter how many dmes a 'western' commentator remarks on the sad
			passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by 'Western'
			technology, by writing.28 These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast
			Asian village women workers inJapanese and US electronics firms described
			by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and sociedes.
			Sumival is the stakes in this play of readings.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions;
			they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of
			women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals - in short, domination
			of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among
			these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female,
			civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/
			made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, totaVpartial, God/man.
			The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the semice of
			the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by
			the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the
			self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be
			One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse
			with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary,
			frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is
			not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine.
			It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into
			coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse
			(for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework
			economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids,
			mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, com-</P>

		<P>178</P>

		<P>munications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological
			separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical
			and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner
			stands as the image of a cyborg culture's fear, love, and confusion.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened.
			The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple
			of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other
			severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense
			experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices.29
			Anne McCaffrey's pre-feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness
			of a cyborg, hybrid of girl's brain and complex machinery, formed after
			the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment,
			skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at
			the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the
			seventeenth century dll now, machines could be animated - given ghostly
			souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development
			and mental capacides. Or organisms could be mechan-ized - reduced to body
			understood as resource of mind. These machine/ organism relationships are
			obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines
			can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don't
			need organic holism to give impermeable whole-ness, the total woman and
			her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial
			reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts,
			feminist science fiction.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic
			the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual
			endty, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions
			is not largely based on idendfication. Students facingJoanna Russ for the
			first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James
			Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The
			Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader's
			search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests,
			exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of
			four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together
			do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove
			the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R.
			Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing
			the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization
			to subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction
			was regarded as particularly manly undl her 'true' gender was revealed,
			tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation
			of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>179</P>

		<P>constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea,
			a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface
			an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler
			writes of an African sorceress pithug her powers of transformation against
			the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of dme warps that bring
			a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her
			white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred),
			and of the illegidmate insights into idendty and community of an adopted
			cross-species child who came to know the enem' as self (Survivor). In Dawn
			(1987), the first instalment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells
			the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam's first and
			repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the
			son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child
			is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic
			exchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers,
			who reform earth's habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving
			humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive,
			linguishc, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth-century
			race and gender.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIn-tyre's
			Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous
			monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and
			feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is 'simply' human, human
			status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak
			with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore
			space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship
			with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors
			carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of
			microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Lacnea becomes
			a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing
			survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives
			a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time
			sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species.
			All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating
			experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and indmacy even
			in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands
			also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense;
			it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse
			in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter. This is a conjunction
			with a long history that many 'First World' feminists have tried to repress,
			including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account
			by Zoe Sofoulis,</P>

		<P>whose different location in the world system's informatics of domin-ation

			cultures, including women's science fiction. From an Australian feminist

			her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.</P>

		<P>Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations.
			The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the
			centred polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and
			boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated
			twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern
			France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and
			legal, portents and diseases -- all crucial to establishing modern identity.30
			The evolutionary and behavioural sciences of monkeys and apes have marked
			the multiple boundaries of late twentieth-century industrial identities.
			Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political
			possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man
			and Woman.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs
			as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power
			and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it
			was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate
			antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony
			for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure
			in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment.
			The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The
			machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible
			for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for
			boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment
			seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to
			mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric exten-sions. Only by being out
			of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses
			that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs
			might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex
			and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even
			if it has profound historical breadth and depth.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity,
			as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists
			have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more
			than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemo-logical
			position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that
			makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>181</P>

		<P>But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the
			exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men's access
			to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart,
			to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility
			taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory
			of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory,
			but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and
			deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language
			to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the
			informatics of domination-- in order to act potently.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>One last image organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on
			metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive
			sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and
			are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders,
			regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth
			of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of
			twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury.
			The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been
			injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities
			for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous
			world without gender.</P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay:
			first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake
			that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second,
			taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology
			means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology,
			and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries
			of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with
			all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible
			means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations.
			Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we
			have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not
			of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an
			imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits
			of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying
			machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both
			are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.</P>
