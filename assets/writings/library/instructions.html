			And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
			Tell that its sculptor  well those passions read<br>
			Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
			The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.<br>

			Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
			Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
			Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
			The lone and level sands stretch far away.'
