	<p>What if I told you that Nothing Matters?
		Would it scare u?
		Would u feel alone?
		Would u be ‘less driven’ 2 ‘succeed’ [via ‘fulfillment’]?
		Would u feel more/less alive?
		Would u still be able 2 exist comfortably?
		I’d hate to break the news to you, but it’s true:
		<b>Nothing Matters</b>.

	<p>Your accomplishments
		mean nothing.

	<p>Think back to a time when you accomplished something.
		You walked across a stage and maybe received a piece
		of paper that symbolized your accomplishment.
		Your entire family showed up. A few close personal
		friends positively reinforced you with in-person greetings
		and social media mentions.

	<p>Afterwards, you celebrated your accomplishment at a
		‘get-together’ at a local restaurant or relative’s house.
		In that moment you felt something.
		Perhaps pride.
		Perhaps you felt alone and empty.
		Perhaps you felt anxiety.
		Perhaps you felt sad the journey was over.

	<p>The entire moment was built to trick you into thinking
		that you did something that matters within the context of
		a world that matters, mainly for the sake of making you
		feel like you matter within the context of that world.
		Don’t be fooled. Let go of the idea that you ever
		accomplished something remotely valuable.
		<b>Nothing Matters</b>.

	<p>The idea that
		Nothing Matters isn’t new.

	<p>Many “great thinkers” have already boldly declared
		‘Nothing Matters, yall!’
		They’ve contextualized the message to be applicable
		within their culture/society.
		No matter who your cultural oppressor is, the conclusion
		is always the same: <b>Nothing Matters</b>.

	<p>Most cultures & civilizations just
		pretend that “Everything Matters” to
		maintain order and control over the
		working class.

	<p>They ‘trick’ the middle-class into believing their rituals
		create ‘moments’ that matter. Moments worth
		‘celebrating’ and ‘indulging’ to forget how insignificant
		they are in a temporary moment. Moments of solitude &
		togetherness create a sense of ‘community.’
		Every moment is temporary, whether it feels like
		everything or doesn’t feel like anything.

	<p>You will always be ‘alone.’ No one will ever ‘know’ you.
		No other human will ever ‘understand’ ‘you.’
		You will never find a ‘community’ where you ‘truly
		belong.’
		Any sense of community is a misleading feeling of
		‘togetherness’ to keep us from killing one another.

	<p>Stop telling yourself that
		you are driven to ‘change
		the world.’

	<p>Nothing Matters, therefore, any idea of there being a
		‘world worth saving’ is 100% false.
		If you think that some ‘cause’, ‘human right’ or creating a
		‘better version of ‘the world’’ matters, you are just caught
		in a temporary moment of hopefulness.
		Hopeful that what you think/’feel’ actually matters.
		There is nothing to ‘influence’ when nothing matters.

	<p>The world does not require a message that actually
		matters.
		You will never change anything ‘significant.’
		You will never really ‘change’ anything.
		Themes of tolerance, acceptance, and world peace are
		arbitrary because there is no world that actually matters.

	<p>Accept the simple fact that <b>Nothing Matters</b> so the ruling
		class doesn’t have complete control over you.
		It’s okay that Nothing Matters. It is ‘liberating.’
		Feel the sweet, sweet relief of nothing mattering.
		Do drugs, have unprotected sex with junkies, and be a
		horrible person to every one that loves you.
		Or just chill and live a ‘reasonable’ life because nothing
		matters & there is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way to live.

	<p>Let go of the arbitrary
		construction process of
		creating a ‘self.’

	<p>“Life” is the process of creating a “self.”
		The “self” is a coping mechanism to create personal
		meaning in a world that is random and meaningless.
		Piecing together “life experiences,” “moments,” & the
		general process of acquiring information into something
		beautiful can sometimes feel “important.”
		However, no “Self” can exist because Nothing Matters.

	<p>In life, you may be driven to ‘be original,’ as if the
		purpose of life is to fulfill the branded message of a
		_____________ commercial.
		This really just means creating a version of your ‘self’
		that you believe matters to other people.
		You may think your life path will venture into unchartered
		territory. You are wrong.
		Most humans will all experience the same random
		bullshit during their meaninglessly similar lives’.

	<p>You are an immemorable piece of shit to other people.
		When you exchange glances with other humans, they do
		not actually notice YOU.
		Every one else wants to drink your potable water, eat
		your groceries, and steal your potential income. They
		want to mate with your partners and have your beautiful
		children.
		<b>Nothing Matters</b>.

	<p><b>Why does what appears to matter so much to them to
			them not matter to you?</b>
		Because Nothing Matters. However, they choose to
		arbitrarily assign value to ‘the forces that construct their
		identity.’
		‘Envy’ and ‘jealousy’ are the most extreme coping
		mechanisms for people who want to believe that things
		actually matter.

	<p><b>You are supposed to be the brightest star in a sky full of
			stars.</b>
		We celebrate people who are allegedly ‘brighter’ than
		ourselves. This creates an unfair & unfounded
		expectation during youth.
		Our school systems should focus on math, science, and
		the tools for coping with a meaningless existence.

	<p><b>Nothing Matters.</b>
		The idea of your ‘self’ in an external world.
		The way you dress.
		The way you interact with other humans & animals.
		The way you take pride in your social context.
		The way you take pride in your morals.
		The way you think you are an extension of something
		besides your self.
		The way other people think you are a ‘good’/’bad’ person.

	<p><b>All of your ambitions are grounded in the misleading
			aspects of society.</b>
		You may feel the pressure to have a disruptive, infinitely
		scalable idea that ‘changes the world.’
		You may believe that you some how deserve to matter
		more than every one else in the world.
		You may be driven to be culturally, socially, and
		historically relevant.

	<p><b>You do not matter more than any one else because no
			single human is actually special.</b>
		No One Matters because Nothing Matters.
		Nothing that any one thinks matters doesn’t actually
		matter due to the mere fact that Nothing Matters.
		No one person ever represents anything more than just
		being some other meaningless motherfucker.

	<p>Eventually, we all reach our maximum earning potential
		and rationalize the daily effort it takes to ‘make a living.’
		Find a a relationship, develop a comforting diet, and
		create rituals with other humans that you generally find
		tolerable or stimulating.
		<b>Spend your time and money finding ways to pass the
			days, creating a ‘self,’ mainly in the form of a consumer
			identity.</b>

	<p>You can’t ‘personalize’ your shelter.
		No ‘space’ will ever be ‘your own.’
		You strive to rent or purchase a box of space that is ‘your
		own.’ You can add meaningless features that add ‘value’
		to your home, as if you are some idiot on HGTV who
		thinks their investment in converting their personal
		space into a ‘reflection of themselves’ is a valuable
		pursuit.

	<p><b>Hardwood floors, backsplashes, ample closet space,
			and double vanities are definitive proof that Nothing
			Matters.</b>
		When you think of your ‘self’ you are actually just
		aggregating your interests and how you spend your time.
		You are biased by your surroundings into irrationally
		valuing anything, and aggressively pursuing.

	<p>Constructing a ‘self’ requires believing in your ‘self.’
		Believing that ‘you’ matter.
		Unfortunately for ‘you’, Nothing Matters.

	<p>Information is arbitrary and
		meaningless, because
		Nothing Matters.

	<p>All information we obtain is biased, incomplete, untrue,
		and arbitrary.
		It is based in meaninglessness, and we can only make
		decisions that are as arbitrary as the information that
		guides our decisions.
		The idea of ‘being informed’ to make any decision
		implies that things matter. Your ‘decision’ is nothing
		more than just an arbitrary choice in an arbitrary world.

	<p>Financial decisions imply that a fair economy determines
		value and ‘market’ changes.
		Romantic & personal decisions imply that human
		interactions can be meaningful.
		Day-to-day decisions are trivial and no meaning or data
		patterns can be derived from them.
		The ‘timely manner’ in which information was delivered
		to influence your decision doesn’t matter.

	<p>Your entire life has allegedly been an ‘educational
		process.’ You went to school. You performed. You may
		or may not have ended up with ‘a career.’
		There is no ‘informed’ self.
		No one is ‘intelligent.’ ‘Learning experiences’ are sad
		rationalizations. We can only become hyper-biased
		based on the way we spend our time and energy.

	<p>All of the information that was presented to you was
		arbitrary & regionally biased. The entire educational
		process is an oppressive ritual meant to fill your head
		with perception of a fair and rational world.
		Education gives you the tools to create a “self” and a
		“version of the world” where a “self” “belongs.”
		Nothing Matters, especially education.

	<p>There is no ‘sense of the world’ to gather from media.
		All media is corrupt and only exists to expand the reach
		of a media outlet, creating a world that doesn’t actually
		exist. The media is just an advertisement that a world
		that a segment of the population wants to believe exists.
		<b>There are no stories that ‘need to be told.’</b>

	<p>No ‘triumphant human spirit’ or ‘sad state of humanity’
		can be extracted from any contemporary or historical
		event.
		No one story ‘represents the current cultural landscape’
		more than any other story. Every storyteller only tells
		stories to showcase their own delusions.

	<p>Following ‘the news’, feeling ‘connected to culture,’ and
		building a ‘unique perspective on the world’ are
		pointless.

	<p><b>Nothing
			Matters.</b>

	<p>There is no elevated self to build from remaining
		connected to channels of information.
		<b>Self-awareness cannot exist.</b>
		Questioning ‘reality’ or ‘widely-proliferated truths’ will
		never be more than just arbitrary mental exercises.
		Humor, insight, and self-awareness are arbitrary
		constructs that represent levels of coping with a
		meaningless world.

	<p>Retaining & applying more information than the average
		human makes you ‘smart.’
		‘Smart’ people are just insecure ass holes who require to
		the validation of existing cultural norms, societal
		institutions & an audience of vocal validators.

	<p>‘Smart’ people pride themselves on how they ‘figured out
		the system’ and ‘excel’ within some arbitrary &
		meaningless context/industry.
		Their conversations are filled with thoughts, ideas, and
		opinions that ‘matter’ about a topic that ‘matters.’
		You don’t need to have meaningful, informed
		conversations. Talk in screams, grunts, and yells
		because Nothing Matters.

	<p>I Googled “Nothing Matters.”
		I ended up reading some existential internet content.

	<p><b>The idea that I found a page on the internet that some
			how represented ‘what I am looking for’ only illustrates
			how pointless & arbitrary the presentation of
			information.</b>
		A business called Google indexed every page on the
		internet to make them searchable. Their algorithm that
		illustrates ‘the truth’ and ‘quality information’ is actually
		just a page generated by a human employed by a
		business that is framed as ‘quality information.’

	<p>Your interests are actually
		constraints meant to
		marginalize you.

	<p>The human experience has turned into a search for not
		only sustainable, but also filling the allowable bandwidth
		of your attention span.
		<b>You are constantly in search of content.</b>
		Infinite content is available hosted on various mediums.
		You believe specific mediums matter more than others.
		None of the content actually matters, because the goal is
		always the same: escape from yourself.

	<p>Content is often disguised as ‘meaningful information’
		and ‘meaningful community experiences.’
		Celebrity news, politics, sports, the arts, ‘the internet’ and
		even fiction might seem “meaningful.”
		Live events, community experiences, sports games,
		festivals and outdoor natural experiences construct a
		“self” that is “doing something” more than “nothing.”

	<p>Content’s main goal is to make you believe that
		something matters, in order to maintain your attention
		span.
		Content is misleads you into rationalizing how what you
		are consuming is a metaphor for the human spirit.
		Nothing Matters.

	<p>Eating food is your daily distraction. It is the perfect
		example of creating an arbitrary industry and artistic
		space out of a basic human need.
		Assigning arbitrary meaning to the fuel that keeps you
		alive.
		Food is a meaningless life experience that has some
		how been turned into an industry that overvalues both
		exotic and locally produced agricultural industries.

	<p>Eventually, you will be hungry again.
		Will you indulge again?
		Will you ‘eat healthy’ again?
		Will you ‘eat poorly’ again?
		Will you find a ‘bargain meal’ again?
		Will your meal satisfy contemporary standards of ethical
		agricultural practices?
		Will you defecate again? Yes.

	<p><b>Stop creating a life narrative.</b>
		There are no ups & downs.
		You did not learn from ‘trials and tribulations.’
		Don’t tell yourself that ‘it all worked out’ when you feel
		like you reached a self-gratifying outcome.
		Nothing worked out because Nothing Matters.

	<p>Obsessing over your control of the narrative of your life
		is pointless because <b>Nothing Matters.</b>
		Your life is as directionless and meaningful as the man
		begging for money at the street corner with a quirky sign.
		Your human interactions are as meaningful as a
		homeless junkie looking for crack.
		We are all just ‘trying’ to ‘survive.’
		Or trying to kill ourselves. [slowly or quickly]

	<p>Anything you ‘feel’ only exists to create a narrative.
		The things you experienced might as well not have
		happened.
		You are just some living organism, meandering thru life,
		living day to day.
		If you want to get existential about it, you can talk about
		how we are ‘floating in space’ on a huge rock, and how
		the sun will eventually explode even if we live forever.

	<p>You could rot in jail.
		You could make $1,000,000 USD (and have to pay ~40%
		of that to the government).
		Either way, you’ll quickly come to the same realization.
		<b>Nothing Matters.</b>

	<p>Accepting that Nothing Matters does not mean that you
		are depressed, or that you believe life is ‘not worth
		living.’
		It just means that you are 100% aware that Nothing
		Matters.

	<p>There is nothing to be THAT happy or THAT sad
		about--all you can do is be influenced by your aggregated
		life experiences.
		Even if you talk yourself into believing ‘something
		matters’ or that ‘everything matters,’ it is mainly driven by
		your own self-interest.

	<p>You are mainly just looking for a comfortable context
		where things appear to ‘matter’, or you just forget about
		the possibility that everything you do/feel/say/think
		might be pointless.
		Work and life don’t need to be ‘balanced.’ Neither your
		career or your life matter, so it is just a false narrative in
		your brain.

	<p>You will never find a ‘career’ that ‘aligns’ with your
		genuine ‘self’ and ‘interests’ in a ‘way that matters’ and
		allows you to ‘positively impact’ ‘the world.’
		You will never find a career that pays you ‘enough.’
		People who talk about the ‘difference they are making’
		are insufferable.

	<p>Based on society’s standards, all you ‘should do’ is
		maximize your hourly worth, ‘save’ enough money to live
		poorly after age 62 (or 75), and refrain from expending
		too much effort trying to make a difference in the world.
		Making a difference in the world isn’t lucrative, unless
		you invent TOMS or something, then you have to feel
		guilty about selling shitty, ugly shoes forever.

	<p>Don’t obsess over thinking you need to spend your time
		doing something that ‘matters.’ We are all trapped in an
		arbitrary industry of labor & commerce that is
		‘completely retarded.’
		Industries were constructed to create barriers to entry,
		prevent disruption, and oppress humanity.

	<p>Human Nature is Misleading.

	<p>Don’t believe ‘human nature.’ <b>Nothing Matters.</b>
		There is something ‘human’ inside of you that wants to
		survive.
		There is also something ‘human’ inside of you that wants
		to feel things all the goddamn time.
		The only thing that makes us all human is the certainty
		that we will all die. There is no connection to try to make
		to other humans to cope with the end of your life.

	<p>Every emotion you feel will eventually pass. In fact,
		there’s no way to even document that your emotions are
		real or grounded in anything.
		It’s scary. Deep down, I do wish that everything mattered
		and the things I want to care about matter.
		I wish I could connect with other people in a deeper,
		real-er way than any one else.
		I want to believe that I’m not just arbitrarily existing.

	<p>I want to believe in a message that can change the
		world.
		I want to believe in myself & the people I love
		comfortably existing in a context that matters.
		However, all of these desires are self-serving, and based
		upon the arbitrary information that I have gathered over
		the course of my life.

	<p><b>Let go of your desire to ‘find your place’ [via
			‘creating a self’] and in a world where you
			matter & are surrounded by people, places
			and things that matter.</b>
		I wish it wasn’t true.
		But Nothing Matters. :-(

	<p><b>Having said that, it’s pretty awesome that Nothing
			Matters.</b>
		You will be on your death bed, or have one last eternal
		lucid moment before your sudden, horrible death
		and think to yourself,
		“The human experience was fucking pointless.”
		or
		“That was S0o0o0ooo0ooOOoo Rand0m!”

	<p>The ‘self’ is embedded in culture & society, which are
		both false constructs.
		The idea of ‘culture’ being something you can identify
		with is false. You are forced into a particular culture and
		“cultural appreciation” is just middle class oppression.
		Art that really expresses the human condition can’t really
		exist.

	<p>No one is selfless because there is no self to forfeit.
		Every day, you are ‘kept informed’ with ‘news.’
		You are led to believe you can ‘influence’ the outside
		world.
		This is new information that enters your media stream.
		It is supposed to make you feel ‘connected’ to ‘a world.’
		It is supposed to ‘inform’ you.

	<p>News doesn’t matter because Nothing Matters.
		Your lifespan is just the amount of time you are on Earth.
		All you really have to do is fill your time with shit
		because Nothing Matters.
		Existing from meal to meal.

	<p>Did you hear the new business was coming to town?
		Did you hear about the governmental policy changes?
		Did you hear about your friend’s exciting life change?
		Did you hear about the fast food chain coming to your
		city?
		Did you hear the sports team result?
		Did you hear about the widely-know human?
		Did you hear about the corruption?
		Did you hear about the inspiring story?

	<p>Did you hear about the next big thing?
		Did you hear about the times changing?
		Did you hear about the technology on the verge of being
		obsolete because of the latest technology?
		Did you hear about the person doing something notable
		in the eyes of the audience that considers an arbitrary
		act to be ‘notable’?
		Did you hear about the latest ‘cultural movement’ that is
		supposed to inspire people (not) to think?

	<p>Did you hear about the tragedy?
		Did you hear about the terrorist attack?
		Did you hear about your immediate family member’s
		terminal illness?
		Did you hear about the ‘deterioration’ of our society?
		Did you hear about how you have to pay for something
		that once was free?

	<p>Did you hear about how something that was once free is
		now for sale?
		Did you miss out on hearing about the event? Sorry.
		Don’t bother paying attention.
		Roll up in a ball on the floor and scream.
		Nothing Matters.

	<p><b>Relationships Are Just
			Temporary Distractions from
			the Absolute Fact that
			Nothing Matters.</b>

	<p>It is human nature to find comfort in connections with
		other beings, cherishing biological, emotional, and
		intellectual connections.
		Relationships are a valiant fight against the “natural”
		human fear of nothing mattering. Shared time and
		experiences matter, constructing a narrative of growth
		with some one who isn’t yourself.

	<p>Expecting other people to be eternally fair, kind,
		considerate, and loving is unrealistic.
		If you want “love,” you will not find it in another person.
		Your concept of “what love” means can only be
		aggregated from acquired information, consumed
		content, and your life experiences.
		You can only really ever ‘love’ yourself. You might get
		fortunate and find some one who can eternally deal with
		the amount you do/don’t love yourself.

	<p>Relationships create some “solitary moment” where you
		hold some one close and say, “Ya know what. Our little
		life together is meaningful.”
		Human nature is so misleading. It is warm, vulnerable,
		and loving.
		Human nature is also insecure, hurtful and resentful.
		Nothing will end ‘well’ because your relationship was just
		a fight against the fact that Nothing Matters.

	<p>Most relationships are constructed on a self-serving,
		unhealthy foundation.
		Desire to be loved. Desire to no longer feel alone. Desire
		to find one’s own self. Desire to correct previous
		relationship’s failures. Desire to eliminate the
		insecurities of another person. Desire to achieve the
		impossible dream of “happiness” in a world where
		Nothing Matters.

	<p>When a person enters into a relationship operating under
		the misconception that “everything matters” or that a
		connection with one human being matters more than
		anything else in the entire world, the “relationship” is
		doomed.

	<p>Only when both members of a relationship accept that
		nothing matters can they establish realistic relationship
		goals. The expectation of a relationship changing
		A relationship is a human construct to rationalize a
		biological need to create a baby, then raise your child in
		a world where “things mater.”

	<p>It is easy to believe that “family matters.”
		Based on biological experiences.
		Family will only ever be a rationalized burden.
		Because you emerged from a networked biological set of
		circumstances, you must honor your lineage.
		Family is a liability, but can also be the ultimate comfort
		[via tradition and ritual].

	<p><b>There are times when you are
			supposed to feel ashamed of
			yourself. You may believe an
			important decision that you made will
			harm yourself or others.</b>

	<p>You’ve made horrible personal/financial decisions.
		You’ve ran yourself into massive amounts of debt.
		You’ve disappointed your immediate family.
		You’ve disappointed yourself.
		You’ve ‘failed’ despite having the opportunity to
		‘prepare.’
		There is no success.
		There is no failure.

	<p><b>Nothing Matters.</b>
		Ambition.
		Accomplishment.
		Feeling Connected to ‘Something.’
		Self.
		Context.
		Frustration.
		Elation.

	<p>Trends.
		Fashion.
		Music.
		Culture.
		The Regional Music Festival.
		Art.
		The Conversation.

		Watching Real Time Live Events.

	<p>The Third World.
		The First World.
		The Second World.
		The Fourth World.
		The Digital Realm.
		The Journey.
		The Destination.
		The Narrative.
		Personal Relationships.

	<p>Orgasms.

	<p>Community Involvement.
		Philanthropy.
		Time.
		Space.
		An internet connected network [via the Internet].
		Memes.
		Feeling in touch with humanity.
		Nothing Matters.

	<p>There is no point in obsessing over the concept of ‘being
		happy.’
		Realistically, you are trapped in something that will
		always resemble ‘your insignificant life.’
		You are basically ‘middle class’, and you will only really
		ever have varying amounts of discretionary income.

	<p><b>Every thing is a meaningless
			business in an oppressive
			industry.</b>

	<p>Because human nature is misleading, realize that every
		industry is built to monopolize the ‘best’ (most
		misleading) wants, needs, and desires of human nature.
		Nothing that even ‘feels’ pure & true is ever sustainable.
		Eventually ‘society’ is just the process of celebrating the
		oppressive mechanisms of middle class life.

	<p>Everything necessary to sustaining ‘healthy’ human
		beings eventually becomes a branded & commodified
		human life experience.
		<b>Groceries, real estate, & transportation = oppression.</b>
		Sports, festivals, live events, marathons, television
		marathons, and anything that consumes your attention
		span eventually becomes a medium against which to sell
		advertising, sucking the alleged “life” out of the organic
		beauty of any art & content.

	<p>Believing ‘things matter’ is just to rationalize your
		insignificant place in the global economy.
		Believing any thing matters is meant to oppress you.
		Believing any thing matters is meant to distract you.
		Believing any thing matters is sometimes necessary in
		order to give the next generation the misleading idea that
		their existence (individually or together) matters.

	<p>Your debt/savings are so inconsequential in the scale of
		the global economy. Some motherfucker wipes his ass
		with the entirety of your annual salary. Trust me. That
		guy thinks your life is meaningless and that you might as
		well ‘kill yourself’ instead of thinking your life ‘matters’
		because of ‘the little things that you find meaningful.’
		That rich ass bro would kill himself if he logged into your
		online banking account.

	<p>You will never save enough for retirement due to
		economic forces that are beyond the control of your
		potential earning power.

	<p>The world is cruel. :-(
		Even when you accomplish something that matters to
		some one, the world is eager to move on.
		The world wants to forget about you.
		The world wants to marginalize you and your purest
		thoughts.
		The world uses your ambitions to enslave you.
		Even if you earn money, you will only be extended credit
		lines to use what you have anyways.

	<p>Most people just want an above average car, shelter that
		they are allowed to pour ‘equity’ into, and the opportunity
		to eat foods that are moderately ‘exotic’ and ‘indulgent’
		without venturing too far into the Third World of Cuisine.

	<p><b>Protect yourself from marginalization by accepting that
			Nothing Matters.
			You won’t get hurt when ‘the world’ reminds you how
			insignificant you are. You set yourself up for failure.</b>
		‘Nothing Matters, you naive idiot.’
		-the World

	<p>It sort of sucks that <b>Nothing Matters.</b> :-(
		It is ‘human’ to feel sad about it, but it also probably
		means your existence has afforded you too many
		insights into ‘the way the world works’ and ‘the faults in a
		meaningful human existence.’

	<p>The feelings of love I have for the people in my life
		probably don’t matter.
		The moment of laughter I enjoyed with my good friend
		probably didn’t matter.
		My meaningful pursuit of a ‘better life’ probably doesn’t
		matter.
		The drive to ‘build a career’ or ‘heighten’ my earning
		potential only exists based on my educational and social
		experiences.

	<p><b>My drive to feel ‘validated’ by an
			arbitrary audience or widely accepted
			social institution is 100% misguided.</b>

	<p><b>My drive to feel ‘the same things’ that
			have been felt by other people has
			only led me to the conclusion that
			Nothing Matters.</b>

	<p><b>There is no more information to
			aggregate. There are no more
			‘interesting humans’ to encounter and
