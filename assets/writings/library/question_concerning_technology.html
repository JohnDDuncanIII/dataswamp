      <h1>The Question Concerning Technology</h1>
      <h3>Martin Heidegger</h3>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p>In what follows we shall be <i>questioning</i> concerning technology.  Questioning builds a way.  We would be advised, therefore, above all to pay heed to the way, and not to fix our attention on isolated sentences and topics.  The way is a way of thinking.  All ways of thinking, more or less perceptibly, lead through language in a manner that is extraordinary.  We shall be questioning concerning <i>technology</i>, and in so doing we should like to prepare a free relationship to it.  The relationship will be free if it opens our human existence to the essence of technology. <a href="#1">[1]</a>  When we can respond to this essence, we shall be able to experience the technological within its own bounds.

    <p>Technology is not equivalent to the essence of technology.  When we are seeking the essence of “tree,” we have to. become aware that That which pervades every tree, as tree, is not itself a tree that can be encountered among all the other trees.

    <p>Likewise, the essence of technology is by no means anything technological.  Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it.  Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.  But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, <a href="#2">[2]</a> to which today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.

    <p>According to ancient doctrine, the essence of a thing is considered to be <i>what</i> the thing is.  We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is.  Everyone knows the two statements that answer our question.  One says: Technology is a means to an end.  The other says: Technology is a human activity.  The two definitions of technology belong together.  For to posit ends and procure and utilize the means to them is a human activity.  The manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools, and machines, the manufactured and used things themselves, and the needs and ends that they serve, all belong to what technology is.  The whole complex of these contrivances is technology.  <mark>Technology itself is a contrivance, or, in Latin, an <i>instrumentum</i>. <a href="#3">[3]</a></mark>

    <p>The current conception of technology, according to which it is a means and a human activity, can therefore be called the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology.

    <p>Who would ever deny that it is correct?  It is in obvious conformity with what we are envisioning when we talk about technology.  The instrumental definition of technology is indeed so uncannily correct that it even holds for modern technology, of which, in other respects, we maintain with some justification that it is, in contrast to the older handwork technology, something completely different and therefore new.  Even the power plant with its turbines and generators is a man-made means to an end established by man.  Even the jet aircraft and the high-frequency apparatus are means to ends.  A radar station is of course less simple than a weather vane.  To be sure, the construction of a high-frequency apparatus requires the interlocking of various processes of technical-industrial production.  And certainly a sawmill in a secluded valley of the Black Forest is a primitive means compared with the hydroelectric plant in the Rhine River.

    <p>But this much remains correct: modern technology too is a means to an end.  That is why the instrumental conception of technology conditions every attempt to bring man into the right relation to technology.  <mark>Everything depends on our manipulating technology in the proper manner as a means.  We will, as we say, “get” technology “spiritually in hand.”  We will master it.  The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent the more technology threatens to slip from human control.</mark>

    <p>But suppose now that technology were no mere means, how would it stand with the will to master it?  Yet we said, did we not, that the instrumental definition of technology is correct?  To be sure.  The correct always fixes upon something pertinent in whatever is under consideration.  However, in order to be correct, this fixing by no means needs to uncover the thing in question in its essence.  Only at the point where such an uncovering happens does the true come to pass. <a href="#4">[4]</a>  For that reason the merely correct is not yet the true.  Only the true brings us into a free relationship with that which concerns us from out of its essence.  Accordingly, the .correct instrumental definition of technology still does not show us technology’s essence.  In order that we may arrive at this, or at least come close to it, we must seek the true by way of the correct.  <mark>We must ask: What is the instrumental itself?</mark>  Within what do such things as means and end belong?  A means is that whereby something is effected and thus attained.  Whatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause.  But not only that by means of which something else is effected is a cause.  The end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause.  Wherever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality.

    <p>For centuries philosophy has taught that there are four causes: <mark>(1) the <i>causa materialis</i>, the material, the matter out of which, for example, a silver chalice is made; (2) the <i>causa formalis</i>, the form, the shape into which the material enters; (3) the <i>causa finalis</i>, the end, for example, the sacrificial rite in relation to which the chalice required is determined as to its form and matter; (4) the <i>causa efficiens</i>, which brings about the effect that is the finished, actual chalice, in this instance, the silversmith.  What technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.</mark>

    <p>But suppose that causality, for its part, is veiled in darkness with respect to what it is?  Certainly for centuries we have acted as though the doctrine of the four causes had fallen from heaven as a truth as clear as daylight.  But it might be that the time has come to ask, Why are there just four causes?  In relation to the aforementioned four, what does “cause” really mean?  From whence does it come that the causal <i>character</i> of the four causes is so unifiedly determined that they belong together?

    <p>So long as we do not allow ourselves to go into these questions, causality, and with it instrumentality, and with the latter the accepted definition of technology, remain obscure and groundless.

    <p>For a long time we have been accustomed to representing cause as that which brings something about.  In this connection, to bring about means to obtain results, effects.  The <i>causa efficiens</i>, but one among the four causes, sets the standard for all causality.  This goes so far that we no longer even count the <i>causa finalis</i>, telic finality, as causality.  <mark><i>Causa, casus</i>, belongs to the verb <i>cadere</i>, “to fall,” and means that which brings it about that something falls out as a result in such and such a way.</mark>  The doctrine of the four causes goes back to Aristotle.  But everything that later ages seek in Greek thought under the conception and rubric “causality,” in the realm of Greek thought and for Greek thought per se has simply nothing at all to do with bringing about and effecting.  What we call cause [<i>Ursache</i>] and the Romans call <i>causa</i> is called <i>aition</i> by the Greeks, that to which something else is indebted [<i>das, was ein anderes verschuldet</i>]. <a href="#5">[5]</a>  The four causes are the ways, all belonging at once to each other, of being responsible for something else.  An example can clarify this.

    <p>Silver is that out of which the silver chalice is made.  As this matter (<i>kyle</i>/<i>hyle</i>), it is co-responsible for the chalice.  The chalice is indebted to, i.e., owes thanks to, the silver for that out of which it consists.  But the sacrificial vessel is indebted not only to the silver.  As a chalice, that which is indebted to the silver appears in the aspect of a chalice and not in that of a brooch or a ring.  Thus the sacrificial vessel is at the same time indebted to the aspect (eidos) of chaliceness.  Both the silver into which the aspect is admitted as chalice and the aspect in which the silver appears are in their respective ways co-responsible for the sacrificial vessel.

    <p>But there remains yet a third that is above all responsible for the sacrificial vessel.  It is that which in advance confines the chalice within the realm of consecration and bestowal. <a href="#6">[6]</a>Through this the chalice is circumscribed as sacrificial vessel.  Circumscribing gives bounds to the thing.  With the bounds the thing does not stop; rather from out of them it begins to be what, after production, it will be.  <mark>That which gives bounds, that which completes, in this sense is called in Greek telos, which is all too often translated as “aim” or “purpose,” and so misinterpreted.  The telos is responsible for what as matter and for what as aspect are together co-responsible for the sacrificial vessel.</mark>

    <p>Finally there is a fourth participant in the responsibility for the finished sacrificial vessel’s lying before us ready for use, i.e., the silversmith - but not at all because he, in working, brings about the finished sacrificial chalice as if it were the effect of a making; the silversmith is not a causa efficiens.

    <p>The Aristotelian doctrine neither knows the cause that is named by this term nor uses a Greek word that would correspond to it.

    <p>The silversmith considers carefully and gathers together the three aforementioned ways of being responsible and indebted.  <mark>To consider carefully [uberlegen] is in Greek legein, logos.  Legein is rooted in apophainesthai, to bring forward into appearance.</mark>  The silversmith is co-responsible as that from whence the sacrificial vessel’s bringing forth and resting-in-self take and retain their first departure.  The three previously mentioned ways of being responsible owe thanks to the pondering of the silversmith for the “that” and. the “how” of their coming into appearance and into play for the production of the sacrificial vessel.

    <p>Thus four ways of being responsible hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us.  They differ from one another, yet they belong together.  What unites them from the beginning?  In what does this playing in unison of the four ways of being responsible play?  What is the source of the unity of the four causes?  What, after all, does this owing and being responsible mean, thought as the Greeks thought it?

    <p>Today we are too easily inclined either to understand being responsible and being indebted moralistically as a lapse, or else to construe them in terms of effecting.  In either case we bar to ourselves the way to the primal meaning of that which is later called causality.  So long as this way is not opened up to us we shall also fail to see what instrumentality, which is based on causality, actually is.

    <p>In order to guard against such misinterpretations of being responsible and being indebted, let us clarify the four ways of being responsible in terms of that for which they are responsible.  According to our example, they are responsible for the silver chalice’s lying ready before us as a sacrificial vessel.  Lying before and lying ready (hypokeisthai) characterize the presencing of something that presences.  The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance.  They let it come forth into presencing [An-wesen]. <a href="#7">[7]</a>  They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely, into its complete arrival.  The principal characteristic of being responsible is this starting something on its way into arrival.  It is in the sense of such a starting something on its way into arrival that being responsible is an occasioning or an inducing to go forward [Ver-an-lassen]. <a href="#8">[8]</a  On the basis of a look at what the Greeks experienced in being responsible, in aitia, we now give this verb “to occasion” a more inclusive meaning, so that it now is the name for the essence of causality thought as the Greeks thought it.  The common and narrower meaning of “occasion” in contrast is nothing more than striking against and releasing, and means a kind of secondary cause within the whole of causality.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>But in what, then, does the playing in unison of the four ways of occasioning play?  They let what is not yet present arrive into presencing.  Accordingly, they are unifiedly ruled over by a bringing that brings what presences into appearance.  Plato tells us what this bringing is in a sentence from the Symposium (205b): [HHC: Greek not reproduced]. “Every occasion for whatever passes over and goes forward into presencing from that which is not presencing is poiesis, is bringing-forth [Her-vor-bringen].” <a href="#9">[9]</a>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>It is of utmost importance that we think bringing-forth in its full scope and at the same time in the sense in which the Greeks thought it.  Not only handcraft manufacture, not only artistic and poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery, is a bringing-forth, poiesis.  Physis also, the arising of something from out of itself, is a bringing-forth, poiesis.  Physis is indeed poiesis in the highest sense.  For what presences by means of physis has the bursting open belonging to bringing-forth, e.g., the bursting of a blossom into bloom, in itself (en heautōi).  In contrast, what is brought forth by the artisan or the artist, e.g., the silver chalice, has the bursting open belonging to bringing-forth not in itself, but in another (en allōi), in the craftsman or artist.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>The modes of occasioning, the four causes, are at play, then, within bringing-forth.  Through bringing-forth, the growing things of nature as well as whatever is completed through the crafts and the arts come at any given time to their appearance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>But how does bringing-forth happen, be it in nature or in handwork and art?  What is the bringing-forth in which the fourfold way of occasioning plays?  Occasioning has to do with the presencing [Anwesen] of that which at any given time comes to appearance in bringing-forth.  Bringing-forth brings hither out of concealment forth into unconcealment.  Bringing-forth comes to pass only insofar as something concealed comes into unconcealment.  This coming rests and moves freely within what we call revealing [das Entbergen]. <a href="#10">[10]</a>  The Greeks have the word aletheia for revealing.  The Romans translate this with veritas.  We say “truth” and usually understand it as the correctness of an idea.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>But where have we strayed to?  We are questioning concerning technology, and we have arrived now at aletheia, at revealing.  What has the essence of technology to do with revealing?  The answer: everything.  For every bringing-forth is grounded in revealing.  Bringing-forth, indeed, gathers within itself the four modes of occasioning – causality - and rules them throughout.  Within its domain belong end and means, belongs instrumentality. <a href="#11">[11]</a>  Instrumentality is considered to be the fundamental characteristic of technology.  If we inquire, step by step, into what technology, represented as means, actually is, then we shall arrive at revealing.  The possibility of all productive manufacturing lies in revealing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Technology is therefore no mere means.  Technology is a way of revealing.  If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us.  It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth. <a href="#12">[12]</a>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>This prospect strikes us as strange.  Indeed, it should do so, should do so as persistently as possible and with so much urgency that we will finally take seriously the simple question of what the name “technology” means.  The word stems from the Greek. Technikon means that which belongs to techne.  We must observe two things with respect to the meaning of this word.  One is that techne is the name not only for the activities and skills of the craftsman, but also for the arts of the mind and the fine arts.  Technë belongs to bringing-forth, to poiësis; it is something poietic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>The other point that we should observe with regard to techne is even more important.  From earliest times until Plato the word techne is linked with the word episteme.  Both words are names for knowing in the widest sense.  They mean to be entirely at home in something, to understand and be expert in it.  Such knowing provides an opening up.  As an opening up it is a revealing.  Aristotle, in a discussion of special importance (Nicomachean Ethics, Bk. VI, chaps. 3 and 4), distinguishes between episteme and techne and indeed with respect to what and how they reveal.  Technë is a mode of aletheuein.  It reveals whatever does not bring itself forth and does not yet lie here before us, whatever can look and turn out now one way and now another.  Whoever builds a house or a ship or forges a sacrificial chalice reveals what is to be brought forth, according to the perspectives of the four modes of occasioning.  This revealing gathers together in advance the aspect and the matter of ship or house, with a view to the finished thing envisioned as completed, and from this gathering determines the manner of its construction.  Thus what is decisive in techne does not lie at all in making and manipulating nor in the using of means, but rather in the aforementioned revealing.  It is as revealing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a bringing-forth.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Thus the clue to what the word techne means and to how the Greeks defined it leads us into the same context that opened itself to us when we pursued the question of what instrumentality as such in truth might be.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Technology is a mode of revealing.  Technology comes to presence [West] in the realm where revealing and unconcealment take place, where aletheia, truth, happens.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>In opposition to this definition of the essential domain of technology, one can object that it indeed holds for Greek thought and that at best it might apply to the techniques of the handcraftsman, but that it simply does not fit modern machine-powered technology.  And it is precisely the latter and it alone that is the disturbing thing, that moves us to ask the question concerning technology per se.  It is said that modern technology is something incomparably different from all earlier technologies because it is based on modern physics as an exact science.  Meanwhile we have come to understand more clearly that the reverse holds true as well: Modern physics, as experimental, is dependent upon technical apparatus and upon progress in the building of apparatus.  The establishing of this mutual relationship between technology and physics is correct.  But it remains a merely historiographical establishing of facts and says nothing about that in which this mutual relationship is grounded.  The decisive question still remains: Of what essence is modern technology that it happens to think of putting exact science to use?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>What is modern technology?  It too is a revealing.  Only when we allow our attention to rest on this fundamental characteristic does that which is new in modern technology show itself to us.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>And yet the revealing that holds sway throughout modern technology does not unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense of poiesis.  The revealing that rules in modern technology is a challenging [Herausfordern], <a href="#13">[13]</a> which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy that can be extracted and stored as such.  But does this not hold true for the old windmill as well?  No.  Its sails do indeed turn in the wind; they are left entirely to the wind’s blowing.  But the windmill does not unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>In contrast, a tract of land is challenged into the putting out of coal and ore.  The earth now reveals itself as a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit.  The field that the peasant formerly cultivated and set in order [besteilte] appears differently than it did when to set in order still meant to take care of and to maintain.  The work of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field.  In the sowing of the grain it places the seed in the keeping of the forces of growth and watches over its increase.  But meanwhile even the cultivation of the field has come under the grip of another kind of setting-in-order, which sets upon [stellt] nature. <a href="#14">[14]</a>  It sets upon it in the sense of challenging it.  Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry.  Air is now set upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, for example; uranium is set upon to yield atomic energy, which can be released either for destruction or for peaceful use.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>This setting-upon that challenges forth the energies of nature is an expediting [Pördern], and in two ways.  It expedites in that it unlocks and exposes.  Yet that expediting is always itself directed from the beginning toward furthering something else, i.e., toward driving on to the maximum yield at the minimum expense.  The coal that has been hauled out in some mining district has not been supplied in order that it may simply be present somewhere or other.  It is stockpiled; that is, it is on call, ready to deliver the sun’s warmth that is stored in it.  The sun’s warmth is challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>The hydroelectric plant is set into the current of the Rhine.  It sets the Rhine to supplying its hydraulic pressure, which then sets the turbines turning.  This turning sets those machines in motion whose thrust sets going the electric current for which the long-distance power station and its network of cables are set up to dispatch electricity. <a href="#15">[15]</a>  In the context of the interlocking processes pertaining to the orderly disposition of electrical energy, even the Rhine itself appears as something at our command.  The hydroelectric plant is not built into the Rhine River as was the old wooden bridge that joined bank with bank for hundreds of years.  Rather the river is dammed up into the power plant.  What the river is now, namely, a water power supplier, derives from out of the essence of the power station.  In order that we may even remotely consider the monstrousness that reigns here, let us ponder for a moment the contrast that speaks out of the two titles, “The Rhine” as dammed up into the power works, and “The Rhine” as uttered out of the art work, in Hölderlin’s hymn by that name.  But, it will be replied, the Rhine is still a river in the landscape, is it not?  Perhaps.  But how?  In no other way than as an object on call for inspection by a tour group ordered there by the vacation industry.

That challenging happens in that the energy concealed in nature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what is transformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed, and what is distributed is switched about ever anew.  Unlocking, transforming, storing, distributing, and switching about are ways of revealing.  But the revealing never simply comes to an end.  Neither does it run off into the indeterminate.  The revealing reveals to itself its own manifoldly interlocking paths, through regulating their course.  This regulating itself is, for its part, everywhere secured.  Regulating and securing even become the chief characteristics of the challenging revealing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>What kind of unconcealment is it, then, that is peculiar to that which comes to stand forth through this setting-upon that challenges?  Everywhere everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately at hand, indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further ordering.  Whatever is ordered about in this way has its own standing.  We call it the standing-reserve [Bestand]. <a href="#16">[16]</a>  The word expresses here something more, and something more essential, than mere “stock.”  The name “standing-reserve” assumes the rank of an inclusive rubric.  It designates nothing less than the way in which everything presences that is wrought upon by the challenging revealing.  Whatever stands by in the sense of standing-reserve no longer stands over against us as object.

Certainly.  We can represent the machine so.  But then it conceals itself as to what and how it is.  Revealed, it stands on the taxi strip only as standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to ensure the possibility of transportation.  For this it must be in. its whole structure and in every one of its constituent parts, on call for duty, i.e., ready for takeoff.  (Here it would be appropriate to discuss Hegel’s definition of the machine as an autonomous tool.  When applied to the tools of the craftsman, his characterization is correct.  Characterized in this way, however, the machine is not thought at all from out of the essence of technology within which it belongs.  Seen in terms of the standing-reserve, the machine is completely unautonomous, for it has its standing only from the ordering of the orderable.)

Obviously, man.  To what extent is man capable of such a revealing?  Man can indeed conceive, fashion, and carry through this or that in one way or another.  But man does not have control over Unconcealment itself, in which at any given time the real shows itself or withdraws.  The fact that the real has been showing itself in the light of Ideas ever since the time of Plato, Plato did not bring about.  The thinker only responded to what addressed itself to him.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Only to the extent that man for his part is already challenged to exploit the energies of nature can this ordering revealing happen.  If man is challenged, ordered, to do this, then does not man himself belong even more originally than nature within the standing-reserve?  The current talk about human resources, about the supply of patients for a clinic, gives evidence of this.  The forester who, in the wood, measures the felled timber and to all appearances walks the same forest path in the same way as did his grandfather is today commanded by profit-making in the lumber industry, whether he knows it or not.  He is made subordinate to the orderability of cellulose, which for its part is challenged forth by the need for paper, which is then delivered to newspapers and illustrated magazines.  The latter, in their turn, set public opinion to swallowing what is printed, so that a set configuration of opinion becomes available on demand.  Yet precisely because man is challenged more originally than are the energies of nature, i.e., into the process of ordering, he never is transformed into mere standing-reserve.  Since man drives technology forward, he takes part in ordering as a way of revealing.  But the unconcealment itself, within which ordering unfolds, is never a human handiwork, any more than is the realm through which man is already passing every time he as a subject relates to an object.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Where and how does this revealing happen if it is no mere handiwork of man?  We need not look far.  We need only apprehend in an unbiased way  That which has already claimed man and has done so, so decisively that he can only be man at any given time as the one so claimed.  Wherever man opens his eyes and ears, unlocks his heart, and gives himself over to meditating and striving, shaping and working, entreating and thanking, he finds himself everywhere already brought into the unconcealed.  The unconcealment of the unconcealed has already come to pass whenever it calls man forth into the modes of revealing allotted to him.  When man, in his way, from within unconcealment reveals that which presences, he merely responds to the call of unconcealment even when he contradicts it.  Thus when man, investigating, observing, ensnares nature as an area of his own conceiving, he has already been claimed by a way of revealing that challenges him to approach nature as an object of research, until even the object disappears into the objectlessness of standing-reserve.

Therefore we must take that challenging that sets upon man to order the real as standing-reserve in accordance with the way in which it shows itself.  That challenging gathers man into ordering.

Gestell is also the name for a skeleton.  And the employment of the word Gestell [Erframing] that is now required of us seems equally eerie, not to speak of the arbitrariness with which words of a mature language are thus misused.  Can anything be more strange?  Surely not.  Yet this strangeness is an old usage of thinking.  And indeed thinkers accord with this usage precisely at the point where it is a matter of thinking that which is highest.  We, late born, are no longer in a position to appreciate the significance of Plato’s daring to use the word eidos for that which in everything and in each particular thing endures as present.  For eidos, in the common speech, meant the outward aspect [Ansicht] that a visible thing offers to the physical eye.  Plato exacts of this word, however, something utterly extraordinary: that it name what precisely is not and never will be perceivable with physical eyes.  But even this is by no means the full extent of what is extraordinary here.  For idea names not only the nonsensuous aspect of what is physically visible. <a href="#18">[18]</a>  Aspect (idea) names and is, also, that which constitutes the essence in the audible, the tasteable, the tactile, in everything that is in any way accessible.  Compared with the demands that Plato makes on language and thought in this and other instances, the use of the word Gestell as the name for the essence of modern technology, which we now venture here, is almost harmless.  Even so, the usage now required remains something exacting and is open to misinterpretation.

Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.  On the other hand, all those things that are so familiar to us and are standard parts of an assembly, such as rods, pistons, and chassis, belong to the technological.  The assembly itself, however, together with the aforementioned stockparts, falls within the sphere of technological activity; and this activity always merely responds to the challenge of Enframing, but it never comprises Enframing itself or brings it about.

At the same time it should preserve the suggestion of another Stellen from which it stems, namely, that producing and presenting [Her- und Dar-stellen] which, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into unconcealment.  This producing that brings forth - e.g., the erecting of a statue in the temple precinct - and the challenging ordering now under consideration are indeed fundamentally different, and yet they remain related in their essence.  Both are ways of revealing, of aletheia.  In Enframing, that unconcealment comes to pass in conformity with which the work of modern technology reveals the real as standing-reserve.  This work is therefore neither only a human activity nor a mere means within such activity.  The merely instrumental, merely anthropological definition of technology is therefore in principle untenable.  And it cannot be rounded out by being referred back to some metaphysical or religious explanation that undergirds it.

That revealing concerns nature, above all, as the chief storehouse of the standing energy reserve.  Accordingly, man’s ordering attitude and behavior display themselves first in the rise of modern physics as an exact science.  Modern science’s way of representing pursues and entraps nature as a calculable coherence of forces.  Modern physics is not experimental physics because it applies apparatus to the questioning of nature.  Rather the reverse is true.  Because physics, indeed already as pure theory, sets nature up to exhibit itself as a coherence of forces calculable in advance, it therefore orders its experiments precisely for the purpose of asking whether and how nature reports itself when set up in this way.

How, then, could it have already been set upon by modern technology and placed in its service?  The facts testify to the contrary.  Surely technology got under way only when it could be supported by exact physical science.  Reckoned chronologically, this is correct.  Thought historically, it does not hit upon the truth.

For already in physics the challenging gathering-together into ordering revealing holds sway.  But in it that gathering does not yet come expressly to appearance.  Modern physics is the herald of Enframing, a herald whose origin is still unknown.  The essence of modern technology has for a long time been concealing itself, even where power machinery has been invented, where electrical technology is in full swing, and where atomic technology is well under way.

The Greek thinkers already knew of this when they said: That which is earlier with regard to the arising that holds sway becomes manifest to us men only later.  That which is primally early shows itself only ultimately to men. <a href="#20">[20]</a>  Therefore, in the realm of thinking, a painstaking effort to think through still more primally what was primally thought is not the absurd wish to revive what is past, but rather the sober readiness to be astounded before the coming of what is early.

In contrast, machine-power technology develops only in the second half of the eighteenth century.  But modern technology, which for chronological reckoning is the later, is, from the point of view of the essence holding sway within it, the historically earlier.

It is challenged forth by the rule of Enframing, which demands that nature be orderable as standing-reserve.  Hence physics, in all its retreating from the representation turned only toward objects that has alone been standard till recently, will never be able to renounce this one thing: that nature reports itself in some way or other that is identifiable through calculation and that it remains orderable as a system of information.  This system is determined, then, out of a causality that has changed once again.  Causality now displays neither the character of the occasioning that brings forth nor the nature of the causa efficiens, let alone that of the causa formalis.  It seems as though causality is shrinking into a reporting - a reporting challenged forth - of standing-reserves that must be guaranteed either simultaneously or in sequence.  To this shrinking would correspond the process of growing resignation that Heisenberg’s lecture depicts in so impressive a manner.*

Through its so doing, the deceptive illusion arises that modern technology is applied physical science.  This illusion can maintain itself only so long as neither the essential origin of modern science nor indeed the essence of modern technology is adequately found out through questioning.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>We are questioning concerning technology in order to bring to light our relationship to its essence.  The essence of modern technology shows itself in what we call Enframing.  But simply to point to this is still in no way to answer the question concerning technology, if to answer means to respond, in the sense of correspond, to the essence of what is being asked about.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Where do we find ourselves brought to, if now we think one step further regarding what Enframing itself actually is?  It is nothing technological, nothing on the order of a machine.  It is the way in which the real reveals itself as standing-reserve.

No.  But neither does it happen exclusively in man, or decisively through man.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Enframing is the gathering together that belongs to that setting-upon which sets upon man and puts him in position to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve.  As the one who is challenged forth in this way, man stands within the essential realm of Enframing.  He can never take up a relationship to it only subsequently.  Thus the question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late.  But never too late comes the question as to whether we actually experience ourselves as the ones whose activities everywhere, public and private, are challenged forth by Enframing.  Above all, never too late comes the question as to whether and how we actually admit ourselves into that wherein Enframing itself comes to presence.

We shall call that sending-that-gathers [versammelde Schicken] which first starts man upon a ‘way of revealing, destining [Geschick]. <a href="#21">[21]</a>  It is from out of this destining that the essence of all history [Geschichte] is determined.  History is neither simply the object of written chronicle nor simply the fulfillment of human activity.  That activity first becomes history as something destined.*  And it is only the destining into objectifying representation that makes the historical accessible as an object for historiography, i.e., for a science, and on this basis makes possible the current equating of the historical with that which is chronicled.

Enframing is an ordaining of destining, as is every way of revealing.  Bringing-forth, poiesis, is also a destining in this sense.

Always the destining of revealing holds complete sway over man.  But that destining is never a fate that compels.  For man becomes truly free only insofar as he belongs to the realm of destining and so becomes one who listens and hears [Hörender], and not one who is simply constrained to obey [Höriger].

All revealing belongs within a harboring and a concealing.  But that which frees - the mystery - is concealed and always concealing itself.  All revealing comes out of the open, goes into the open, and brings into the open.  The freedom of the open consists neither in unfettered arbitrariness nor in the constraint of mere laws.  Freedom is that which conceals in a way that opens to light, in whose clearing there shimmers that veil that covers what comes to presence of all truth and lets the veil appear as what veils.  Freedom is the realm of the destining that at any given time starts a revealing upon its way.

Enframing belongs within the destining of revealing.  These sentences express something different from the talk that we hear more frequently, to the effect that technology is the fate of our age, where “fate” means the inevitableness of an unalterable course.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>But when we consider the essence of technology, then we experience Enframing as a destining of revealing.  In this way we are already sojourning within the open space of destining, a destining that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it and curse it as the work of the devil.  Quite to the contrary, when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.

Its holding sway belongs within destining.  Since destining at any given time starts man on a way of revealing, man, thus under way, is continually approaching the brink of the possibility of pursuing and pushing forward nothing but what is revealed in ordering, and of deriving all his standards on this basis.  Through this the other possibility is blocked, that man might be admitted more and sooner and ever more primally to the essence of that which is unconcealed and to its unconcealment, in order that he might experience as his essence his needed belonging to revealing.

The destining of revealing is as such, in every one of its modes, and therefore necessarily, danger.

Thus where everything that presences exhibits itself in the light of a cause-effect coherence, even God can, for representational thinking, lose all that is exalted and holy, the mysteriousness of his distance.  In the light of causality, God can sink to the level of a cause, of causa efficiens.  He then becomes, even in theology, the god of the philosophers, namely, of those who define the unconcealed and the concealed in terms of the causality of making, without ever considering the essential origin of this causality.

This danger attests itself to us in two ways.  As soon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man even as object, but does so, rather, exclusively as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve, then he comes to the very brink of a precipitous fall; that is, he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve.  Meanwhile man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth.  In this way the impression comes to prevail that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his construct.  This illusion gives rise in turn to one final delusion: It seems as though man everywhere and always encounters only himself.  Heisenberg has with complete correctness pointed out that the real must present itself to contemporary man in this way.*  In truth, however, precisely nowhere does man today any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence.  Man stands so decisively in attendance on the challenging-forth of Enframing that he does not apprehend Enframing as a claim, that he fails to see himself as the one spoken to, and hence also fails in every way to hear in what respect he ek-sists, from out of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, and thus can never encounter only himself.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>But Enframing does not simply endanger man in his relationship to himself and to everything that is.  As a destining, it banishes man into that kind of revealing which is an ordering.  Where this ordering holds sway, it drives out every other possibility of revealing.  Above all, Enframing conceals that revealing which, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into appearance.  As compared with that other revealing, the setting-upon that challenges forth thrusts man into a relation to that which is, that is at once antithetical and rigorously ordered.  Where Enframing holds sway, regulating and securing of the standing-reserve mark all revealing.  They no longer even let their own fundamental characteristic appear, namely, this revealing as such.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Thus the challenging Enframing not only conceals a former way of revealing, bringing-forth, but it conceals revealing itself and with it That wherein unconcealment, i.e., truth, comes to pass.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Enframing blocks the shining-forth and holding-sway of truth.  The destining that sends into ordering is consequently the extreme danger.  What is dangerous is not technology.  There is no demonry of technology, but rather there is the mystery of its essence.  The essence of technology, as a destining of revealing, is the danger.  The transformed meaning of the word “Enframing” will perhaps become somewhat more familiar to us now if we think Enframing in the sense of destining and danger.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>The threat to man does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology.  The actual threat has already affected man in his essence.  The rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.

What does it mean “to save”?  Usually we think that it means only to seize hold of a thing threatened by ruin, in order to secure it in its former continuance.  But the verb “to save” says more. “To save” is to fetch something home into its essence, in order to bring the essence for the first time into its genuine appearing.  If the essence of technology, Enframing, is the extreme danger, and if there is truth in Hölderlin’s words, then the rule of Enframing cannot exhaust itself solely in blocking all lighting-up of every revealing, all appearing of truth.  Rather, precisely the essence of technology must harbor in itself the growth of the saving power.  But in that case, might not an adequate look into what Enframing is as a destining of revealing bring into appearance the saving power in its arising?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>In what respect does the saving power grow there also where the danger is?  Where something grows, there it takes root, from thence it thrives.  Both happen concealedly and quietly and in their own time.  But according to the words of the poet we have no right whatsoever to expect that there where the danger is we should be able to lay hold of the saving power immediately and without preparation.  Therefore we must consider now, in advance, in what respect the saving power does most profoundly take root and thence thrive even in that wherein the extreme danger lies, in the holding sway of Enframing.  In order to consider this, it is necessary, as a last step upon our way, to look with yet clearer eyes into the danger.  Accordingly, we must once more question concerning technology.  For we have said that in technology’s essence roots and thrives the saving power.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Thus far we have understood “essence” in its current meaning.  In the academic language of philosophy, “essence” means what something is; in Latin, quid. Quidditas, whatness, provides the answer to the question concerning essence.  For example, what pertains to all kinds of trees - oaks, beeches, birches, firs - is the same “treeness.”  Under this inclusive genus - the “universal” -  fall all real and possible trees.  Is then the essence of technology, Enframing, the common genus for everything technological?  If that were the case then the steam turbine, the radio transmitter, and the cyclotron would each be an Enframing.  But the word “Enframing” does not mean here a tool or any kind of apparatus.  Still less does it mean the general concept of such resources.  The machines and apparatus are no more cases and kinds of Enframing than are the man at the switchboard and the engineer in the drafting room.  Each of these in its own way indeed belongs as stockpart, available resource, or executer, within Enframing; but Enframing is never the essence of technology in the sense of a genus.  Enframing is a way of revealing having the character of destining, namely, the way that challenges forth.  The revealing that brings forth (poiesis) is also a way that has the character of destining.  But these ways are not kinds that, arrayed beside one another, fall under the concept of revealing.  Revealing is that destining which, ever suddenly and inexplicably to all thinking, apportions itself into the revealing that brings forth and that also challenges, and which allots itself to man.  The challenging revealing has its origin as a destining in bringing-forth.  But at the same time Enframing, in a way characteristic of a destining, blocks poiēsis.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Thus Enframing, as a destining of revealing, is indeed the essence of technology, but never in the sense of genus and essentia.  If we pay heed to this, something astounding strikes us:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>It is technology itself that makes the demand on us to think in another way what is usually understood by “essence.”  But in what way?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>If we speak of the “essence of a house” and the “essence of a state,” we do not mean a generic type; rather we mean the ways in which house and state hold sway, administer themselves, develop and decay - the way in which they “essence” [Wesen].  Johann Peter Hebel in a poem, “Ghost on Kanderer Street,” for which Goethe had a special fondness, uses the old word die Weserei.  It means the city hall inasmuch as there the life of the community gathers and village existence is constantly in play, i.e., comes to presence.  It is from the verb wesen that the noun is derived.  Wesen understood as a verb is the same as währen [to last or endure], not only in terms of meaning, but also in terms of the phonetic formation of the word.  Socrates and Plato already think the essence of something as what essences, what comes to presence, in the sense of what endures.  But they think what endures as what remains permanently [das Fortwährende] (aei on).  And they find what endures permanently in what, as that which remains, tenaciously persists throughout all that happens.  That which remains they discover, in turn, in the aspect [Aussehen] (eidos, idea), for example, the Idea “house.”

Particular, real, and possible houses, in contrast, are changing and transitory derivatives of the Idea and thus belong to what does not endure.

But is enduring only permanent enduring?  Does the essence of technology endure in the sense of the permanent enduring of an Idea that hovers over everything technological, thus making it seem that by technology we mean some mythological abstraction?  The way in which technology essences lets itself be seen only from out of that permanent enduring in which Enframing comes to pass as a destining of revealing.  Goethe once uses the mysterious word fortgewähren [to grant permanently] in place of fortwähren [to endure permanently].*  He hears währen [to endure] and gewähren [to grant] here in one unarticulated accord. <a href="#24">[24]</a>  And if we now ponder more carefully than we did before what it is that actually endures and perhaps alone endures, we may venture to say: Only what is granted endures.  That which endures primally out of the earliest beginning is what grants. <a href="#25">[25]</a>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>As the essencing of technology, Enframing is that which endures.  Does Enframing hold sway at all in the sense of granting?  No doubt the question seems a horrendous blunder.  For according to everything that has been said, Enframing is, rather, a destining that gathers together into the revealing that challenges forth.  Challenging is anything but a granting.  So it seems, so long as we do not notice that the challenging-forth into the ordering of the real as standing-reserve still remains a destining that starts man upon a way of revealing.  As this destining, the coming to presence of technology gives man entry into That which, of himself, he can neither invent nor in any way make.  For there is no such thing as a man who, solely of himself, is only man.

Yes, most emphatically, if in this destining the saving power is said to grow.  Every destining of revealing comes to pass from out of a granting and as such a granting.  For it is granting that first conveys to man that share in revealing which the coming-to-pass of revealing needs. <a href="#26">[26]</a>  As the one so needed and used, man is given to belong to the coming-to-pass of truth.  The granting that sends in one way or another into revealing is as such the saving power.  For the saving power lets man see and enter into the highest dignity of his essence.  This dignity lies in keeping watch over the unconcealment - and with it, from the first, the concealment - of all coming to presence on this earth.  It is precisely in Enframing, which threatens to sweep man away into ordering as the supposed single way of revealing, and so thrusts man into the danger of the surrender of his free essence - it is precisely in this extreme danger that the innermost indestructible belongingness of man within granting may come to light, provided that we, for our part, begin to pay heed to the coming to presence of technology.

How can this happen?  Above all through our catching sight of what comes to presence in technology, instead of merely staring at the technological.  So long as we represent technology as an instrument, we remain held fast in the will to master it.  We press on past the essence of technology.

Yet the more questioningly we ponder the essence of technology, the more mysterious the essence of art becomes.

One of Heidegger’s principal aims in this essay is to seek the true meaning of essence through or by way of the “correct” meaning.  He will later show that Wesen does not simply mean what something is, but that it means, further, the way in which something pursues its course, the way in which it remains through time as what it is.  Heidegger writes elsewhere that the noun Wesen does not mean quidditas originally, but rather “enduring as presence” (das Währen als Gegenwart).  (See An introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Ralph Manheim [New York: Doubleday, 1961], p. 59.)  Wesen as a noun derives from the verb wesen, which is seldom used as such in modern German.  The verb survives primarily in inflected forms of the verb sein (to be) and in such words as the adjective anwesend (present).  The old verbal forms from which wesen stems meant to tarry or dwell.  Heidegger repeatedly identifies wesen as “the same as währen [to last or endure].”  (See p. 30 below and SR 161.)  As a verb, wesen will usually be translated [here with “to come to presence,” a rendering wherein the meaning “endure” should be strongly heard.  Occasionally it will be translated “to essence,” and its gerund will be rendered with “essencing.”  The noun Wesen will regularly be translated “essence” until Heidegger’s explanatory discussion is reached.  Thereafter, in this and the succeeding essays, it will often be translated with “coming to presence.”  In relation to all these renderings, the reader should bear in mind a point that is of fundamental importance to Heidegger, namely, that the root of wesen, with its meaning “to dwell,” provides one integral component in the meaning of the verb sein (to be).

Elsewhere in this volume, Vorstellung will usually be translated by “representation,” and its related verb vorsteflen by “to represent.”  Both “conception” and “representation” should suggest a placing or setting-up-before.

Instrumentum signifies that which functions to heap or build up or to arrange.  Heidegger here equates it with the noun Einrichtung, translated “contrivance,” which can also mean arrangement, adjustment, furnishing, or equipment.  In accordance with his dictum that the true must be sought by way of the correct, Heidegger here anticipates with his identification of technology as an instrumentum and an Einrichtung his later “true” characterization of technology in terms of setting-in-place, ordering, Enframing, and standing-reserve.</a>

Das, was ein anderes verschuldet is a quite idomatic expression that here would mean to many German readers “that which is the cause of something else.”  The verb verschulden actually has a wide range of meanings - to be indebted, to owe, to be guilty, to be responsible for or to, to cause.  Heidegger intends to awaken all these meanings and to have connotations of mutual interdependence sound throughout this passage.</a>

Literally, “confines into” - the German preposition in with the accusative.  Heidegger often uses this construction in ways that are unusual in German, as they would be in English.

By writing An-wesen, Heidegger stresses the composition of the verb anwesen, translated as “to presence.”  The verb consists of wesen (literally, to continue or endure) with the prepositional prefix an- (at, to, toward).  It is man who must receive presencing, man to whom it comes as enduring.  Cf. On Time and Being, trans. Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper & Row, 1972), p. 12.</a>

Ver-an-lassen is Heidegger’s writing of the verb veranlassen in noun form, now hyphenated to bring out its meaning.  Veranlassen ordinarily means to occasion, to cause, to bring about, to call forth.  Its use here relates back to the use of anlassen (to leave [something] on, to let loose, to set going), here translated “to start something on its way.”  Anlassen has just been similarly written as an-lassen so as to emphasize its composition from lassen (to let or leave) and an (to or toward).  One of the functions of the German prefix ver- is to intensify the force of a verb.  André Préau quotes Heidegger as saying: “Ver-an-lassen is more active than an-lassen.  The ver-, as it were, pushes the latter toward a doing [vers un faire].”  Cf. Martin Heidegger, Essais et Conferences (Paris: Gallimard, 1958), p. 16 n.</a>

The full gamut of meaning for the verb hervorbringen, here functioning as a noun, includes to bring forth or produce, to generate or beget, to utter, to elicit.  Heidegger intends that all of these nuances be heard.  He hyphenates the word in order to emphasize its adverbial prefixes, her- (here or hither) and vor- (forward or forth).  Heidegger elsewhere makes specific the meaning resident in Her-vor-bringen for him by utilizing those prefixes independently.  Thus he says (translating literally), “Bringing-forth-hither brings hither out of concealment, forth into unconcealment” (cf. below, p. 11); and - after identifying working (wirken) and her-vor-bringen - he says that working must be understood as “bringing hither-into unconcealment, forth-into presencing” (SR 161).  Because of the awkwardness of the English phrase “to bring forth hither,” it has not been possible to include in the translation of her-vor-bringen the nuance of meaning that her- provides.</a>

The verb entbergen (to reveal) and the allied noun Entbergung (revealing) are unique to Heidegger.  Because of the exigencies of translation, entbergen must usually be translated with “revealing,” and the presence of Entbergung, which is rather infrequently used, has therefore regrettably been obscured for want of an appropriate English noun as alternative that would be sufficiently active in meaning.  Entbergen and Entbergung are formed from the verb bergen and the verbal prefix ent-.  Bergen means to rescue, to recover, to secure, to harbor, to conceal.  Ent- is used in German verbs to connote in one way or another a change from an existing situation.  It can mean “forth” or “out” or can connote a change that is the negating of a former condition.  Entbergen connotes an opening out from protective concealing, a harboring forth.  For a presentation of Heidegger’s central tenet that it is only as protected and preserved - and that means as enclosed and secure - that anything is set free to endure, to continue as that which it is, i.e., to be, see “Building Dwelling Thinking” in Poetry, Language, Thought, trans. Albert Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row, 1971), p. 149, and cf. p. 25 below.</a>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Entbergen and Entbergung join a family of words all formed from Bergen-verbergen (to conceal), Verborgenheit (concealment), das Verbor gene (the concealed), Unverborgenheit (unconcealment), das Llnverborgene (the unconcealed) - of which Heidegger makes frequent use.  The lack of viable English words sufficiently numerous to permit a similar use of but one fundamental stem has made it necessary to obscure, through the use of “reveal,” the close relationship among all the words just mentioned.  None of the English words used – “reveal,” “conceal,” “unconceal” - evinces with any adequacy the meaning resident in bergen itself; yet the reader should be constantly aware that the full range of connotation present in bergen sounds for Heidegger within all these, its derivatives.</a>

    <p><a name="11">11. Here and elsewhere “belongs within” translates the German gehört in with the accusative (literally, belongs into), an unusual usage that Heidegger often employs.  The regular German construction is gehort zu (belongs to).  With the use of “belongs into,” Heidegger intends to suggest a relationship involving origin.</a>

    <p><a name="12">12. Heidegger here hyphenates the word Wahrheit (truth) so as to expose its stem, wahr.  He points out elsewhere that words with this stem have a common derivation and underlying meaning (SR 165).  Such words often show the connotations of attentive watchfulness and guarding that he there finds in their Greek cognates, horaa, are, e.g., wahren (to watch over and keep safe) and bewahren (to preserve).  Hyphenating Wahrheit draws it overtly into this circle of meaning.  It points to the fact that in truth, which is unconcealment (Unverborgenheit), a safekeeping carries itself Out. Wahrheit thus offers here a very close parallel to its companion noun Entbergung (revealing; literally, harboring forth), built on bergen (to rescue, to harbor, to conceal).  See n. 10, above.  For a further discussion of words built around wahr, see T 42, n. 9.</a>

    <p><a name="13">13. Herausfordern means to challenge, to call forth or summon to action, to demand positively, to provoke.  It is composed of the verb fordern (to demand, to summon, to challenge) and the adverbial prefixes her- (hither) and aus- (out).  The verb might be rendered very literally as “to demand out hither.”  The structural similarity between herausfordern and her-vorbringen (to bring forth hither) is readily apparent.  It serves of itself to point up the relation subsisting between the two modes of revealing of which the verbs speak - modes that, in the very distinctive ways peculiar to them, occasion a coming forth into unconcealment and presencing. See below, 29-30.</a>

    <p><a name="14">14. The verb stellen (to place or set) has a wide variety of uses.  It can mean to put in place, to order, to arrange, to furnish or supply, and, in a military context, to challenge or engage.  Here Heidegger sees the connotations of herausfordern (to challenge, to call forth, to demand out hither) as fundamentally determinative of the meaning of stellen, and this remains true throughout his ensuing discussion.  The translation of stellen with “to set upon” is intended to carry this meaning.  The connotations of setting in place and of supplying that lie within the word stellen remain strongly present in Heidegger’s repeated use of the verb hereafter, however, since the “setting-upon” of which it speaks is inherently a setting in place so as to supply.  Where these latter meanings come decisively to the fore, stellen has been translated with “to set” or “to set up,” or, rarely, with “to supply.”</a>

      Stellen embraces the meanings of a whole family of verbs: besteilen (to order, command; to set in order), vorsteilen (to represent), sicherstellen (to secure), nachstellen (to entrap), verstellen (to block or disguise), herstelien (to produce, to set here), darstelien (to present or exhibit), and so on.  In these verbs the various nuances within stellen are reinforced and made specific.  All these meanings are gathered together in Heidegger’s unique use of the word that is pivotal for him, Ge-stell (Enframing).  Cf. pp. 19 ff.  See also the opening paragraph of “The Turning,” pp. 36-37.</a>

<p><a name="15">15. In these two sentences, in order to show something of the manner in which Heidegger gathers together a family of meanings, a series of stellen verbs - stellen (three times); herstellen, bestellen - have been translated with verbal expressions formed around “set.”  For the usual meanings of these verbs, see n. 14.</a>

<p><a name="16">16. Bestand ordinarily denotes a store or supply as “standing by.”  It carries the connotation of the verb bestehen with its dual meaning of to last and to undergo.  Heidegger uses the word to characterize the manner in which everything commanded into place and ordered according to the challenging demand ruling in modern technology presences as revealed.  He wishes to stress here not the permanency, but the orderability and substitutability of objects.  Bestand contrasts with Gegenstand (object; that which stands over against).  Objects indeed lose their character as objects when they are caught up in the “standing-reserve.”  Cf. Introduction, p. xxix.</a>

<p><a name="17">17. The translation “Enframing” for Ge-steil is intended to suggest, through the use of the prefix “en-,” something of the active meaning that Heidegger here gives to the German word.  While following the discussion that now ensues, in which Enframing assumes a central role, the reader should be careful not to interpret the word as though it simply meant a framework of some sort.  Instead he should constantly remember that Enframing is fundamentally a calling-forth.  It is a “challenging claim,” a demanding summons, that “gathers” so as to reveal.  This claim en frames in that it assembles and orders.  It puts into a framework or configuration everything that it summons forth, through an ordering for use that it is forever restructuring anew. Cf. Introduction, pp. xxix ff.</a>

<p><a name="19">19. “Coming to presence” here translates the gerund Wesende, a verbal form that appears, in this volume, only in this essay.  With the introduction into the discussion of “coming to presence” as an alternate translation of the noun Wesen (essence), subsequent to Heidegger’s consideration of the meaning of essence below (pp. 30 ff.), occasionally the presence of das Wesende is regrettably but unavoidably obscured.</a>

<p><a name="20">20. “That which is primally early” translates die anfangliche Prühe.

<p><a name="24">24. The verb gewähren is closely allied to the verbs währen (to endure) and währen (to watch over, to keep safe, to preserve).  Gewâhren ordinarily means to be surety for, to warrant, to vouchsafe, to grant.  In the discussion that follows, the verb will be translated simply with “to grant.”  But the reader should keep in mind also the connotations of safeguarding and guaranteeing that are present in it as well.</a>

<p><a name="25">25. Nur das Gewährte währt. Das anfänglich aus der Frühe Währende ist das Gewährende.  A literal translation of the second sentence would be, “That which endures primally from out of the early…”  On the meaning of “the early,” see n. 20 above.</a>

<p><a name="26">26. Here and subsequently in this essay, “coming-to-pass” translates the noun Ereignis.  Elsewhere, in “The Turning,” this word, in accordance with the deeper meaning that Heidegger there finds for it, will be translated with “disclosing that brings into its own.” See T 45; see also Introduction, pp. xxxvi-xxxvii.</a>

<p><a name="27">27. “Safekeeping” translates the noun Wahrnis, which is unique to Heidegger.  Wahrnis is closely related to the verb währen (to watch over, to keep safe, to preserve), integrally related to Wahrheit (truth), and closely akin to währen (to endure) and gewähren (to be surety for, to grant).  On the meaning of Wahrnis, see T 42, n. 9 and n. 12 above.</a>
