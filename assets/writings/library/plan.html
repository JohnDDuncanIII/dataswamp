	<pre>[Intro]
		(In her eyes tonight
		There’s a glow tonight
		They’re so bright they could light
		Fountainbleu tonight
		She’s so gracious
		So vivacious
		She is not thinking of me

		Bless her little heart
		Crooked to the core
		Acting out a part
		What a rollicking, frollicking bore!

		She’s such fun tonight
		She’s a treat tonight
		You could spread her on bread
		She’s so sweet tonight)
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 1]
		When everyone you have ever loved is finally gone
		When everything you have ever wanted is finally done with
		When all of your nightmares are for a time obscured
		As by a shining brainless beacon
		Or a blinding eclipse of the many terrible shapes of this world
		When you are calm and joyful
		And finally entirely alone
		Then in a great new darkness
		You will finally execute your special plan
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 2]
		One needs to have a plan someone said who was turned away into the shadows
		And who I had believed was sleeping or dead
		Imagine he said all the flesh that is eaten
		The teeth tearing into it
		The tongue tasting it's savour
		And the hunger for that taste
		Now take away that flesh he said
		Take away the teeth and the tongue
		The taste and the hunger
		Take away everything as it is
		That was my plan
		My own special plan for this world
		I listened to these words and yet I did not wonder
		If this creature whom I had thought sleeping or dead would ever approach his vision
		Even in his deepest dreams
		Or his most lasting death
		Because I had heard of such plans such visions
		And I knew they did not see far enough
		But what was demanded in a way of a plan
		Needed to go beyond tongue and teeth and hunger and flesh
		Beyond the bones and the very dust of bones and the wind that would come to blow the dust away
		And so I began to envision a darkness that was long before the dark of night
		And a strangely shining light
		That owed nothing to the light of day
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 3]
		That day may seem like other days
		Once more we feel the tiny legged trepidations
		Once more we are mangled by a great grinding fear
		But that day will have no others after
		No more worlds like this will follow
		Because I have a plan
		A very special plan
		No more worlds like this
		No more days like that
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 4]
		There are but four ways to die a sardonic spirit might have said to me
		There is dying that occurs relatively suddenly
		There is dying that occurs relatively gradually
		There is dying that occurs relatively painlessly
		There is the death that is full of pain
		Thus by various means they are combined
		The sudden and the gradual
		The painless and the painful
		To yield but four ways to die
		And there are no others
		Even after the voice stopped speaking
		I listened for it to speak again
		After hours and day and years have passed
		I listened for some further words
		Yet all I heard were the faintest echoes reminding me
		There are no others
		There are no others
		Was it then that I began to conceive for this world
		A special plan?
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 5]
		There are no means for escaping this world
		It penetrates even into your sleep
		And is its substance
		You are caught in your own dreaming
		Where there is no space
		And are held forever where there is no time
		You can do nothing you aren't told to do
		There is no hope for escape from this dream
		That was never yours
		The very words you speak are only its very words
		And you talk like a traitor
		Under its incessant torture
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 6]
		There are many who have designs upon this world
		And dream of wild and vast reformations
		I have heard them talking in their sleep
		Of elegant mutations
		And cunning annihilations
		I have heard them whispering in the corners of crooked houses
		And in the alleys and narrow back streets of this crooked creaking universe
		Which they with their new designs were made straight and sound
		But each of these new and ill conceived designs
		Is deranged in it's heart
		For they see this world as if it were alone and original
		And not as only one of count with others
		Whose nightmares all precede
		Like a hideous garden grown from a single seed
		I have heard these dreamers talking in their sleep
		And I stand waiting for them
		As at the top of a darkened flight of stairs
		They know nothing of me
		And none of the secrets of my special plan
		While I know every crooked creaking step of theirs
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 7]
		It was the voice of someone who was waiting in the shadows
		Who was looking at the moon and waiting for me to turn the corner
		And enter a narrow street
		And stand with him in the dull glaze of moonlight
		Then he said to me
		He whispered
		That my plan was misconceived
		That my special plan for this world was a terrible mistake
		Because, he said, there is nothing to do and there is no where to go
		There is nothing to be and there is no one to know
		Your plan is a mistake, he repeated
		This world is a mistake, I replied
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 8]
		The children always followed him
		When they saw him hopping by
		A funny walk
		A funny man
		A funny, funny, funny man
		He made them laugh sometimes
		He made them laugh, oh yes he did
		He did, he did, he did, he did
		Oh how he made them roll
		One day he took them to a place
		He knew a special place
		And told them things about this world
		This funny, funny, funny world
		Which made them laugh sometimes
		He made them laugh, oh yes he did
		He did, he did, he did, he did
		Oh how he made them roll
		Then the funny man who made them laugh
		Sometimes he did
		Revealed to them his special plan
		His very special funny plan
		Knowing they would understand
		And maybe laugh sometimes
		He made them laugh
		Oh yes he did
		He did, he did, he did, he did
		Their eyes grew wide beneath their lids
		And how he made them roll
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 9]
		I first learned the facts from a lunatic
		In a dark and quiet room that smelled of stale time and space
		There are no people
		Nothing at all like that
		The human phenomenon is but the sum of densely coiled layers of illusion
		Each of which winds itself upon the supreme insanity
		That there are persons of any kind
		When all that can be is mindless mirrors
		Laughing and screaming as they parade about
		In an endless dream
		But when I asked the lunatic what it was that saw itself within these mirrors
		As they marched endlessly in stale time and space
		He only rocked and smiled
		Then he laughed and screamed
		And in his black and empty eyes
		I saw for a moment, as in a mirror
		A formless shade of divinity
		In flight from its stale infinity
		Of time and space and the worst of all
		Of this world's dreams
		My special plan for the laughter
		And the screams
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 10]
		We went to see some little show
		That was staged in an old shed
		Past the edge of town
		And in its beginnings all seemed well
		The miniature curtain stage glowed in the darkness
		While those dolls bounced along on their strings before our eyes
		And in its beginnings all seemed well
		But then there came a subtle turning point which some have noticed
		And I was one
		Who quietly left the show
		No, I did not
		Because I could see where things were going
		As the antics of those dolls grew strange
		And the fragile strings grew taut
		With their tiny pullings, tiny limbs
		The others around me became appalled
		And turned away and abandoned the show
		That was staged in an old shed
		Past the edge of town
		But I wanted to witness what could never be
		I wanted to see what could not be seen
		But the moment of consummate disaster
		When puppets turn to face the puppet master
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 11]
		It was twilight and I stood in a greyish haze of the vast empty building
		When the silence was enriched by a reverberant voice
		All the things of this world it said
		Are of but one essence
		For which there are no words
		This is the greater part which has no beginning or end
		And the one essence of this world for which there can be no words
		Is that all the things of this world
		This is the lesser part which had a beginning and shall have an end
		And for which words were conceived solely to speak of
		The tiny broken beings of this world it said
		The beginnings and endings of this world it said
		For which words were conceived solely to speak of
		Now remove these words and what remains it asks me
		As I stood in the twilight of that vast empty building
		But I did not answer
		The question echoed over and over
		But I remained silent until the echoes died
		And as twilight passed into the evening I felt my
		Special plan for which there are no words
		Moving towards a greater darkness
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 12]
		There are some who have no voices
		Or none that will ever speak
		Because of the things they know about this world
		And the things they feel about this world
		Because the thoughts that fill a brain
		That is a damaged brain
		Because the pain that fills a body
		That is a damaged body
		Exists in other worlds
		Countless other worlds
		Each of which stands alone in an infinite empty blackness
		For which no words are being conceived
		And where no voices are able to speak
		When a brain is filled only with damaged thoughts
		When a damaged body is filled only with pain
		And stands alone in a world surrounded by infinite empty blackness
		And exists in a world for which there is no special plan
	</pre>

	<pre>[Verse 13]
		When everyone you have ever loved is finally gone
		When everything you have ever wanted is finally done with
		When all of your nightmares are for a time obscured
		As by a shining brainless beacon
		Or a blinding eclipse of the many terrible shapes of this world
		When you are calm and joyful
		And finally entirely alone
		Then in a great new darkness
		You will finally execute your special plan
