	<P>
		A Spectre is haunting multinational capitalism--the spectre
		of free information.  All the powers of ``globalism'' have entered
		into an unholy alliance to exorcize this spectre: Microsoft and
		Disney, the World Trade Organization, the United States Congress and
		the European Commission.  

	<P>
		Where are the advocates of freedom in the new digital society who have
		not been decried as pirates, anarchists, communists?  Have we not seen
		that many of those hurling the epithets were merely thieves in power,
		whose talk of ``intellectual property'' was nothing more than an
		attempt to retain unjustifiable privileges in a society irrevocably
		changing?  But it is acknowledged by all the Powers of Globalism that
		the movement for freedom is itself a Power, and it is high time that
		we should publish our views in the face of the whole world, to meet
		this nursery tale of the Spectre of Free Information with a Manifesto
		of our own.

	<P>

				Owners and Creators</A>
		</H1>

	<P>
		Throughout the world the movement for free information announces the
		arrival of a new social structure, born of the transformation of
		bourgeois industrial society by the digital technology of its
		own invention.  

	<P>
		The history of all hitherto existing societies reveals a history of
		class struggles.

	<P>
		Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master
		and journeyman, bourgeois and proletarian, imperialist and subaltern,
		in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to
		one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight,
		a fight that has often ended, either in a revolutionary
		re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the
		contending classes.

	<P>
		The industrial society that sprouted from the worldwide expansion of
		European power ushering in modernity did not do away with class
		antagonisms.  It but established new classes, new conditions of
		oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  But the
		epoch of the bourgeoisie simplified the class antagonisms.  Society as
		a whole seemed divided into two great hostile camps, into two great
		classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

	<P>
		But revolution did not by and large occur, and the ``dictatorship of
		the proletariat,'' where it arose or claimed to arise, proved
		incapable of instituting freedom.  Instead, capitalism was enabled by
		technology to secure for itself a measure of consent.  The modern
		laborer in the advanced societies rose with the progress of industry,
		rather than sinking deeper and deeper below the conditions of
		existence of his own class.  Pauperism did not develop more rapidly
		than population and wealth.  Rationalized industry in the Fordist
		style turned industrial workers not into a pauperized proletariat, but
		rather into mass consumers of mass production.  Civilizing the
		proletariat became part of the self-protective program of the
		bourgeoisie.

	<P>
		In this way, universal education and an end to the industrial
		exploitation of children became no longer the despised program of the
		proletarian revolutionary, but the standard of bourgeois social
		morality.  With universal education, workers became literate in the
		media that could stimulate them to additional consumption.  The
		development of sound recording, telephony, moving pictures, and radio
		and television broadcasting changed the workers' relationship to
		bourgeois culture, even as it profoundly altered the culture itself.

	<P>
		Music, for example, throughout previous human history was an acutely
		perishable non-commodity, a social process, occurring in a place and
		at a time, consumed where it was made, by people who were indistinctly
		differentiated as consumers and as makers.  After the adoption of
		recording, music was a non-persishable commodity that could be moved
		long distances and was necessarily alienated from those who made it.
		Music became, as an article of consumption, an opportunity for its new
		``owners'' to direct additional consumption, to create wants on the
		part of the new mass consuming class, and to drive its demand in
		directions profitable to ownership.  So too with the entirely new medium
		of the moving picture, which within decades reoriented the nature of
		human cognition, capturing a substantial fraction of every worker's
		day for the reception of messages ordering additional consumption.
		Tens of thousands of such advertisements passed before the eyes of
		each child every year, reducing to a new form of serfdom the children
		liberated from tending a productive machine: they were now
		compulsorily enlisted in tending the machinery of consumption.

	<P>
		Thus the conditions of bourgeois society were made less narrow, better
		able to comprise the wealth created by them.  Thus was cured the
		absurd epidemic of recurrent over-production.  No longer was there too
		much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry,
		too much commerce.

	<P>
		But the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising
		the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of
		production, and with them the whole relations of society. Constant
		revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
		conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
		bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.  All fixed, fast-frozen
		relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and
		opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before
		they can ossify.  All that is solid melts into air.

	<P>
		With the adoption of digital technology, the system of mass consumer
		production supported by mass consumer culture gave birth to new social
		conditions out of which a new structure of class antagonism
		precipitates.  

	<P>
		The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of
		production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws
		all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap
		prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it
		batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians'
		intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate.  It compels
		all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt its culture and its
		principles of intellectual ownership; it compels them to introduce
		what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois
		themselves.  In one word, it creates a world after its own image.  But
		the very instruments of its communication and acculturation establish
		the modes of resistance which are turned against itself.

	<P>
		Digital technology transforms the bourgeois economy.  The dominant
		goods in the system of production--the articles of cultural
		consumption that are both commodities sold and instructions to the
		worker on what and how to buy--along with all other forms of culture
		and knowledge now have zero marginal cost.  Anyone and everyone may
		have the benefit of all works of culture: music, art, literature,
		technical information, science, and every other form of knowledge.
		Barriers of social inequality and geographic isolation dissolve.  In
		place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we
		have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of
		people.  And as in material, so also in intellectual production.  The
		intellectual creations of individual people become common property.
		Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange
		and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of
		production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer's apprentice, who is
		no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has
		called up by his spells.  

	<P>
		With this change, man is at last compelled to face with sober senses
		his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.  Society
		confronts the simple fact that when everyone can possess every
		intellectual work of beauty and utility--reaping all the human value
		of every increase of knowledge--at the same cost that any one person
		can possess them, it is no longer moral to exclude.  If Rome
		possessed the power to feed everyone amply at no greater cost than
		that of Caesar's own table, the people would sweep Caesar violently
		away if anyone were left to starve.  But the bourgeois system of
		ownership demands that knowledge and culture be rationed by the
		ability to pay.  Alternative traditional forms, made newly viable by
		the technology of interconnection, comprising voluntary associations
		of those who create and those who support, must be forced into unequal
		competition with ownership's overwhelmingly powerful systems of mass
		communication.  Those systems of mass communication are in turn based
		on the appropriation of the people's common rights in the
		electromagnetic spectrum.  Throughout the digital society the classes
		of knowledge workers--artists, musicians, writers, students,
		technologists and others trying to gain in their conditions of life by
		copying and modifying information--are radicalized by the conflict
		between what they know is possible and what the ideology of the
		bourgeois compels them to accept.  Out of that discordance arises the
		consciousness of a new class, and with its rise to self-consciousness
		the fall of ownership begins.

	<P>
		The advance of digital society, whose involuntary promoter is the
		bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the creators, due to
		competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association.
		Creators of knowledge, technology, and culture discover that they no
		longer require the structure of production based on ownership and the
		structure of distribution based on coercion of payment.  Association,
		and its anarchist model of propertyless production, makes possible the
		creation of free software, through which creators gain control of the
		technology of further production.<A NAME="tex2html2"
						    HREF="#foot21"><strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp;</A> The network itself,
		freed of the control of broadcasters and other bandwidth owners,
		becomes the locus of a new system of distribution, based on
		association among peers without hierarchical control, which replaces
		the coercive system of distribution for all music, video, and other
		soft goods.  Universities, libraries, and related institutions become
		allies of the new class, interpreting their historic role as
		distributors of knowledge to require them to offer increasingly
		complete access to the knowledge in their stewardship to all people,
		freely.  The liberation of information from the control of ownership
		liberates the worker from his imposed role as custodian of the
		machine.  Free information allows the worker to invest her time not in
		the consumption of bourgeois culture, with its increasingly urgent
		invitations to sterile consumption, but in the cultivation of her mind
		and her skills.  Increasingly aware of her powers of creation, she
		ceases to be a passive participant in the systems of production and
		consumption in which bourgeois society entrapped her.

	<P>
		But the bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an
		end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  It has pitilessly
		torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ``natural
		superiors,'' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man
		than naked self-interest, than callous ``cash payment.''  It has
		drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of
		chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water
		of egotistical calculation.  It has resolved personal worth into
		exchange value.  And in place of the numberless and feasible chartered
		freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.
		In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political
		illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

	<P>
		Against the forthcoming profound liberation of the working classes,
		whose access to knowledge and information power now
		transcends their previous narrow role as consumers of mass culture,
		the system of bourgeois ownership therefore necessarily contends to
		its very last.  With its preferred instrument of Free Trade, ownership
		attempts to bring about the very crisis of over-production it once
		feared.  Desperate to entrap the creators in their role as waged
		consumers, bourgeois ownership attempts to turn material deprivation
		in some parts of the globe into a source of cheap goods with which to
		bribe back into cultural passivity not the barbarians, but its own
		most prized possession--the educated technological laborers of the
		most advanced societies.

	<P>
		At this stage the workers and creators still form an incoherent mass
		scattered over the whole globe, and remain broken up by their mutual
		competition.  Now and then the creators are victorious, but only for a
		time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate
		result, but in the ever-expanding union.  This union is helped on by
		the improved means of communication that are created by modern
		industry and that place the workers and creators of different
		localities in contact with one another.  It was just this contact that
		was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same
		character, into one national struggle between classes.  But every
		class struggle is a political struggle.  And that union, to attain
		which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways,
		required centuries, the modern knowledge workers, thanks to the
		network, achieve in a few years.

	<P>

		<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
				Freedom and Creation</A>
		</H1>

	<P>
		Not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to
		itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield
		those weapons--the digital working class--the creators.  Possessed
		of skills and knowledges that create both social and exchange value,
		resisting reduction to the status of commodity, capable collectively
		of producing all the technologies of freedom, such workmen cannot be
		reduced to appendages of the machine.  Where once bonds of ignorance
		and geographical isolation tied the proletarian to the industrial army
		in which he formed an indistinguishable and disposable component,
		creators collectively wielding control over the network of human
		communications retain their individuality, and offer the value of
		their intellectual labor through a variety of arrangements more
		favorable to their welfare, and to their freedom, than the system of
		bourgeois ownership ever conceded them.

	<P>
		But in precise proportion to the success of the creators in
		establishing the genuinely free economy, the bourgeoisie must
		reinforce the structure of coercive production and distribution
		concealed within its supposed preference for ``free markets'' and
		``free trade.''  Though ultimately prepared to defend by force
		arrangements that depend on force, however masked, the bourgeoisie at
		first attempts the reimposition of coercion through its preferred
		instrument of compulsion, the institutions of its law.  Like the
		<I>ancien r&#233;gime</I> in France, which believed that feudal property
		could be maintained by conservative force of law despite the
		modernization of society, the owners of bourgeois culture expect their
		law of property to provide a magic bulwark against the forces they
		have themselves released.  

	<P>
		At a certain stage in the development of the means of
		production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society
		produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and
		manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property
		became no longer compatible with the already developed productive
		forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they
		were burst asunder.

	<P>
		Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and
		political constitution adapted to it, and by the economic and
		political sway of the bourgeois class.  But ``free competition'' was
		never more than an aspiration of bourgeois society, which constantly
		experienced the capitalists' intrinsic preference for monopoly.
		Bourgeois property exemplified the concept of monopoly, denying at the
		level of practical arrangements the dogma of freedom bourgeois law
		inconsistently proclaimed.  As, in the new digital society, creators
		establish genuinely free forms of economic activity, the dogma of
		bourgeois property comes into active conflict with the dogma of
		bourgeois freedom.  Protecting the ownership of ideas requires the
		suppression of free technology, which means the suppression of free
		speech.  The power of the State is employed to prohibit free creation.
		Scientists, artists, engineers and students are prevented from
		creating or sharing knowledge, on the ground that their ideas imperil
		the owners' property in the system of cultural production and
		distribution.  It is in the courts of the owners that the creators
		find their class identity most clearly, and it is there, accordingly,
		that the conflict begins.  

	<P>
		But the law of bourgeois property is not a magic amulet against the
		consequences of bourgeois technology: the broom of the sorcerer's
		apprentice will keep sweeping, and the water continues to rise.  It is
		in the domain of technology that the defeat of ownership finally
		occurs, as the new modes of production and distribution burst the
		fetters of the outmoded law.

	<P>
		All the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify
		their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their
		conditions of appropriation.  Knowledge workers cannot become masters of
		the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own
		previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous
		mode of appropriation.  Theirs is the revolutionary dedication to
		freedom: to the abolition of the ownership of ideas, to the free
		circulation of knowledge, and the restoration of culture as the
		symbolic commons that all human beings share.  

	<P>
		To the owners of culture, we say: You are horrified at our intending
		to do away with private property in ideas.  But in your existing
		society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of
		the population.  What they create is immediately appropriated by their
		employers, who claim the fruit of their intellect through the law of
		patent, copyright, trade secret and other forms of ``intellectual
		property.''  Their birthright in the electromagnetic spectrum, which
		can allow all people to communicate with and learn from one another,
		freely, at almost inexhaustible capacity for nominal cost, has been
		taken from them by the bourgeoisie, and is returned to them as
		articles of consumption--broadcast culture, and telecommunications
		services--for which they pay dearly.  Their creativity finds no
		outlet: their music, their art, their storytelling is drowned out by
		the commodities of capitalist culture, amplified by all the power of
		the oligopoly of ``broadcasting,'' before which they are supposed to
		remain passive, consuming rather than creating.  In short, the
		property you lament is the proceeds of theft: its existence for the
		few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of everyone else.
		You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of
		property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the
		non-existence of any such property for the immense majority of society.

	<P>
		It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property in
		ideas and culture all creative work will cease, for lack of
		``incentive,'' and universal laziness will overtake us.

	<P>
		According to this, there ought to have been no music, art, technology,
		or learning before the advent of the bourgeoisie, which alone
		conceived of subjecting the entirety of knowledge and culture to the
		cash nexus.  Faced with the advent of free production and free
		technology, with free software, and with the resulting development of
		free distribution technology, this argument simply denies the visible
		and unanswerable facts.  Fact is subordinated to dogma,
		in which the arrangements that briefly characterized
		intellectual production and cultural distribution during the short
		heyday of the bourgeoisie are said, despite the evidence of both past
		and present, to be the only structures possible.

	<P>
		Thus we say to the owners:  The misconception that induces you to
		transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms
		springing from your present mode of production and form of
		property--historical relations that rise and disappear in the
		progress of production--this misconception you share with every
		ruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the case
		of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property,
		you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois
		form of property.

	<P>
		Our theoretical conclusions are in no way based on ideas or principles
		that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be
		universal reformer.  They merely express, in general terms, actual
		relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical
		movement going on under our very eyes.

	<P>
		When people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do but
		express the fact, that within the old society, the elements of a new
		one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps
		even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.

	<P>
		We, the creators of the free information society, mean to wrest from
		the bourgeoisie, by degrees, the shared patrimony of humankind.  We
		intend the resumption of the cultural inheritance stolen from us under
		the guise of ``intellectual property,'' as well as the medium of
		electromagnetic transportation.  We are committed to the struggle for
		free speech, free knowledge, and free technology.  The measures by
		which we advance that struggle will of course be different in
		different countries, but the following will be
		pretty generally applicable:

	<P>

		<OL>
			<LI>Abolition of all forms of private property in ideas.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Withdrawal of all exclusive licenses, privileges and rights 
				to use of electromagnetic spectrum.  Nullification of all conveyances
				of permanent title to electromagnetic frequencies.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Development of electromagnetic spectrum infrastructure that
				implements every person's equal right to communicate.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Common social development of computer programs and all other
				forms of software, including genetic information, as public goods.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Full respect for freedom of speech, including all forms of
				technical speech.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Protection for the integrity of creative works.

				<P>
			</LI>
			<LI>Free and equal access to all publicly-produced information and
				all educational material used in all branches of the public education
				system.
			</LI>
		</OL>

	<P>
		By these and other means, we commit ourselves to the revolution that
		liberates the human mind.  In overthrowing the system of private
		property in ideas, we bring into existence a truly just society, in
		which the free development of each is the condition for the free
		development of all.
