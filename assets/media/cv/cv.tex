Program offers a select group of eight Gettysburg College students the chance to develop both their \textbf{leadership skills} and \textbf{knowledge \& understanding of public policy}. Our 2016-2017 research focus was domestic refugee policy.
\begin{itemize}
\item Researched and wrote the `New Technologies' section for the group \href{https://www.state.gov/s/partnerships/ppp/diplab/}{\textbf{State Department Diplomacy Lab}} \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5fjh9FZOHSYT1dhVF8yYmd4UEk/view?usp=sharing}{White Paper} on Health Care Records in Mixed-Migration settings. We presented our findings to workers from the \textit{Office of Economic Security, International Health and Biodefense Population, Refugees, and Migration} at the State Department. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Physical research for this project included: a trip to the United Nations, dinners, and meetings with experts in Europe and resettled Syrian refugees in Pennsylvania.
\end{itemize}
\item Co-organized and moderated \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/assets/media/EI_panel_f16.pdf}{two} \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/assets/media/EI_panel_s17_second.pdf}{panels} that detailed current issues in \textbf{public policy, civics, national security, and refugee rights}. 
\item Gave a presentation detailing our 2016-2017 activities to the EINAC (Eisenhower Institute National Advisory Council) in Washington, D.C. Members of the EINAC include the granddaughter of a past U.S. president, the president of Gettysburg College, a member of the 9/11 Commission, and other notable alumni/donors.

Also able to set up a basic home file server in Windows and Unix environments, setting up a multi-router switch, and end-user local area network in Cisco Packet Tracer and with real hardware.
	\item Disclosed two bugs in the Gettysburg Campus Navigation Portal (CNAV) electronic record keeping system. The first bug allowed any user to delete any other user account from a CNAV `group' (mailing list). According to the Vice President of IT on campus, the bug lay dormant since he himself wrote that portion of the CNAV server software in the mid-1990s. The second bug leaked all internal account images to the web. Received a cash award.
