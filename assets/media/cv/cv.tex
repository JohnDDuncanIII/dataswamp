\section*{Major Projects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d6u7eK2fBJElrRpEn1KlkTfReKO_tHj5iCAGb6vgtmg/}{MIT Lincoln Laboratory Internship} (web/android; java/javascript/geoJSON/xml)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As part of my summer work at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory (Summer '16), I created an android application (LEAV-EM) and a javascript web module for the LEAV and HVX programs, respectively. LEAV-EM alerts users in disaster affected areas (hurricanes/floods/tornadoes) to evacuate from their specific evacuation zone. State Emergency Managers (EMs) have the ability to set the status of the evacuation zones in my HVX module. LEAV-EM then routes users to the shelter that is closest to their current (or home) location and allows the user to directly interact with their state EMs. I designed, programmed, and developed the app individually.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/wiki}{Wiki}/\href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/blog}{CMS} (web; golang/flat-file db)

Neller). Available for download from the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.gettysburg.pokersquares}{Google Play Store}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/RedLightRace}{RedLightRace} (android; java/xml; neural-net): 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed, implemented, and coded an Android application called \say{Red Light Race} published to the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.gettysburg.redlight}{Google Play Store} and utilizing a neural network approximately player created by Dr. Todd W. Neller and Marcin Malec (‘13) of Gettysburg College. Featured on the Gettysburg College \href{http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=16f6ea27-401c-42b2-bf77-c5c8ab319ee1}{Homepage} for my work.

Sources ranged from pre-release Macintosh versions based on the XEROX STAR operating system all the way up to pre-release versions of OS X (rhapsody).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/Platinum}{Platinum OS X Theme} (macOS; .car hacking/GIMP):

	\begin{itemize}
	\item I suppose my homepage could be considered a major project. All html, css, (and most) js were written by me. I also created a markdown-to-html shell conversion script (using sed and awk) for my blog and a 7-day \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/assets/scripts/weather.js}{weather forecast script} which parses information from the NWS api \& gets the current location w/ HTML5 geolocation.

\section*{Philosophy}
Simplicity is core to my software development, because it leads to;
\begin{itemize}
	\item fewer bugs,
	\item better performance,
	\item lower memory footprint,
	\item better maintainability,
	\item higher scalability,
	\item longer software lifetime, 
	\item prompt delivery; 
\end{itemize}
...all of which lead to a better quality finished product.

\section*{Hobbies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item computer programming since 2009
    \item design (user interface, software, cyberpunk)
    \item philosophy (of software, knowledge, aesthetics, technology)
    \item music (singing, listening to all genres \& varieties, playing guitar, bass guitar, and trumpet)
    \item programming \& open source
    \item history (technology/web-related, ancient)
    \item biotechnology, sustainable ecology, \& biohacking
\end{itemize}

I devote much of my free time to developing and exploring software and software technologies. I am passionate about trying to port as much free and open-source software to macOS as possible.\\

I am a hobbyist philosopher, UNIX hacker, and political, economic, and media theorist.\\

I'm a free and open-source software enthusiasist. My website is full of online applications, source code and articles that can be used to examine my style.\\

When it comes to software and design, I am passionate about simplicity, beauty, and purity. I have done some 9front development, and highly recommend Plan 9 from Bell Labs for hobbyist OS developers.\\

My design aesthetic is highly influenced by the 80's and 90's computer art movements. When designing, I attempt to blend the best of color-constrained bitmap graphics (dithered/small color palettes), florals, neons, black \& white, and "retro" patterns (found on old tour busses, operating systems, programs) with modern platforms and features.
