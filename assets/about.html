The moment of consumate disaster, when puppets turn to face the puppetmaster ... ... <br> It was twilight and I stood in a greyish haze of the vast empty building When the silence was enriched by a reverberant voice. All the things of this world, it said, Are of but one essence For which there are no words. This is the greater part which has no beginning or end. And the one essence of this world for which there can be no words Is that all the things of this world. This is the lesser part which had a beginning and shall have an end. And for which words were conceived solely to speak of. The tiny broken beings of this world it said. The beginnings and endings of this world it said. For which words were conceived solely to speak of. Now remove these words and what remains it asks me As I stood in the twilight of that vast empty building. But I did not answer. The question echoed over and over, But I remained silent until the echoes died. And as twilight passed into the evening I felt my Special plan for which there are no words Moving towards a greater darkness ... ... <br> There are some who have no voices Or none that will ever speak, Because of the things they know about this world And the things they feel about this world ... Exist in other worlds. Countless other worlds, Each of which stands alone in an infinite empty blackness For which no words are being conceived And where no voices are able to speak. When a brain is filled only with damaged thoughts. When a damaged body is filled only with pain And stands alone in a world surrounded by infinite empty blackness And exists in a world for which there is no special plan ... ... When everyone you have ever loved is finally gone. When everything you have ever wanted is finally done with. When all of your nightmares are for a time obscured ... When you are calm and joyful And finally entirely alone, Then in a great new darkness You will finally execute your special plan."</i>
