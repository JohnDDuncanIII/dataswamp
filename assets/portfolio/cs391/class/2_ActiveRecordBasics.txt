Active Record is the ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

    Database records are called hashes
    Create an Articles record
		bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text
	This yields the Active Record model as follows:
		app/Models/article.rb (this is basically an empty class definition, the fields will be taken from the table in the db)
		db/migrate/...._create_articles.rb  (this creates the table in the db)
		
			class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
			  def change
				create_table :articles do |t|
				  t.string :title
				  t.text :content

				  t.timestamps
				end
			  end
			end
		
		run the rails db:migrate command, table is created.
		run rails console to show using this object.
			rails console
			rec = Article.new(title: "test", content: "This is a test")
			rec (prints object)
			puts rec.title (prints title)
			rec.to_json (prints article as json object)
			rec.save
			Article.all
			rec = Article.new title: "test1", content: "Test 1 data"
			rec
			rec.save
			Article.all
			
			for f in Article.all
			    puts f.title
			end
			
			for f in Article.all
			    puts f.to_json
			end
			
			Article.all.each do |f|
			    puts f.title
			end
			
			Article.all.to_json
			
			Article.delete(1)
			
			Article.all.each do |f|
			    f.delete
			end
